"""
TX meter test harness for the agent automation bridge.

Hardware-in-the-loop transmit + meter validation, built from the lessons of the
manual TX runs:

  * Single-instant meter reads are unreliable — meters update at different rates
    (PACURRENT is only reported ~1 s into TX). This harness SAMPLES OVER THE
    KEYED WINDOW and uses the per-meter `age_ms` the bridge now reports to reject
    stale values (a 0 with a stale/absent age is not a real reading).
  * The tuner must already be BYPASSED. Restoring a tuned state requires RF, so
    the harness refuses to change it behind the operator's back.
  * A radio power control is a percentage, not watts. The harness requires an
    explicit measured-watt ceiling and unkeys on the first fresh sample above
    it. This is a reactive backstop; begin at a conservative percentage.
  * Two-tone uses Tune Power, not RF Power. Stage and verify Tune Power before
    starting it instead of inheriting the last sweep value.
  * It never leaves the radio keyed: every burst is short, unkey-verified, and
    the bridge's TX watchdog is a final backstop.

SAFETY: requires AETHER_AUTOMATION_ALLOW_TX=1 on the app. Requires the exact TX
antenna and a calibrated live forward-power meter, gates every burst on measured
watts and SWR, and aborts on missing telemetry or any unkey failure. Use into a
dummy load.

Usage:
