"""Derive the ANAN-G2 DDC droop-correction curve from the Saturn gateware's
own filter definition, instead of measuring it with a bench sweep.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The panadapter roll-off at the edges of a G2's DDC span is NOT CIC droop,
which is what our source comments have said since 2026-08-24. The Saturn
DDC chain is:

    ADC 122.88 MSPS -> CIC (6 stages, differential delay 1, R = 10..320)
                    -> FIR (1024 taps, decimate by 8, 18-bit coefficients)
                    -> DDC output at 122.88e6 / (R * 8)

which reproduces all six P2 rates exactly (R=320 -> 48 ksps ... R=10 ->
1536 ksps). Across the DDC OUTPUT band the CIC contributes at most 0.34 dB
and varies by 0.003 dB between the fastest and slowest rate. Essentially
all of the roll-off is the anti-alias FIR's transition band.

That FIR is fully specified in the Saturn repo, so the correction curve is
computable in closed form -- no radio required, no sweep, no per-unit
measurement, and identical at every rate by construction.

Sources (both GPL-3, same as AetherSDR):
  FPGA/sources/coefficientfiles/tx1024cfirImpulse.coe

      (name says "tx" and its comment calls it an example TX filter with CIC
      equaliser -- but it is what BOTH the standalone DDCIP project and the
      built saturn_project reference as the RX DDC FIR's CoefficientSource,
      and its response matches six independently measured rates to <1 dB.)
  FPGA/IP/DDCIP/.../DDC_Block_fir_compiler_0_0.xci   decimate 8, 2 channels
  FPGA/IP/DDCIP/.../DDC_Block_cic_compiler_{0,1}_0.xci  6 stages, dd 1

The reasoning above is the whole argument; AnanDroopDefaults.h carries the
in-tree summary and the provenance of the emitted table.
