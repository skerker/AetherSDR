AetherSDR test-registration location checker.

Every test target is declared in tests/tests.cmake. The root CMakeLists.txt used
to hold all 300+ of them and was 6,357 lines because of it; the split cut it to
~2,780. The risk after a move like that is drift back: someone — a contributor
following a stale doc, or an agent pattern-matching on the neighbourhood where
the tests used to live — appends a new target to the root file, and it works.
Nothing breaks. It just quietly rebuilds the pile.

tests/tests.cmake already fails the CONFIGURE step if that happens, which is the
primary guard and gives the fastest feedback. This is the second line: it catches
the cases a configure-time check cannot, notably a reviewer reading a diff on
GitHub without building it, and a stale build tree that never re-runs cmake.

Deliberately narrow: it checks WHERE test targets are declared, nothing about
whether they are any good.

Usage:
    python tools/check_test_registration.py            # report, exit 0
    python tools/check_test_registration.py --strict   # exit 1 on a stray
