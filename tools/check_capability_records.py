"""RadioCapabilities boolean ratchet — #5262 M2.

WHY THIS EXISTS. M2's convention is that a new capability lands as a per-feature
record (`std::optional<FeatureRecord>` — engaged = present, fields = shape), the
`cwText*` pattern generalized, rather than as another loose boolean. Two failure
modes drove that:

  * BOOLEAN FISSION. A bool encodes a yes/no that turns out to have shape. When
    the second radio family arrives the bool splits — `hasRadioSideDsp` became
    four tiers, `hostModulates` became two fields — and every consumer of the
    old name has to be found and re-reasoned.
  * THE ALL-DEFAULTS-FALSE TRAP. A bool has a default, so a backend that simply
    forgets to set it reports a definite "no" indistinguishable from a
    considered one. An absent optional says "not declared".

The convention was written down and did not hold: #5299 alone added seven new
bools after M2 was recorded. So it is a ratchet now, not a convention.

WHY A COUNT AND NOT A NAME SET. The point is to stop the population growing, not
to freeze which capabilities exist — renaming or reordering a bool is fine, and
a name set would make ordinary churn fail the check for no benefit. A count also
states the goal plainly: this number goes down.

ALSO: THE COUNT IS NOT WHAT GREP SAYS. `grep -c '^\\s*bool '` over this header
reports 74, and that figure reached #5262 and its planning comments. Three of
those are `operator==` declarations inside the nested helper structs
(DeclaredBandRange, RxFilterPreset, RxFilterControl), which are not capability
fields at all. This parser counts DIRECT bool members of RadioCapabilities only
— 71 at the freeze.

A precision about HOW, because the obvious explanation is wrong (#5619 review):
those three are excluded by the START OFFSET, not by the depth tracking. They
are declared ABOVE `struct RadioCapabilities`, so the scan never reaches them.

The depth tracking earns its keep separately, on a nested type declared INSIDE
the struct: `enum class ClientSettingsDomain : quint32 {` at RadioCapabilities.h
:356. Its enumerators are not bools so nothing would be miscounted today, but
the guard is exercised rather than dormant.

(An earlier revision of this docstring claimed there were no nested types and
called the guard unexercised. That was wrong, and it is the third time in this
file's short history that a comment credited a mechanism other than the one
running — worth stating, because the parser's correctness is the only thing
standing behind the frozen number. Make it the fourth and fifth: #5860's review
found the anti-vacuity floor below, and its ::error text, still crediting the
multi-line `/* */` blind spot that the same PR had already retired. Both are
corrected in place. This defect is not incidental to the file, it is its
characteristic one — when you change a mechanism here, grep for what described
it.)

WHAT A COUNT CANNOT SEE. Converting one bool to a record while adding another in
the same commit leaves the number flat and passes. That is inherent to counting
rather than a defect — a name set would catch the swap but fail on ordinary
renames and reordering, which is the churn this deliberately tolerates. The
review that catches the swap is a human one.

MAX_PLAUSIBLE_DROP = 15

# ---- Statement boundaries that are not `;` (#5860) ----
# direct_bool_fields() splits on `;` and then requires each fragment to BEGIN
# with `bool`. So anything that ends a statement WITHOUT a semicolon gets glued
# onto the front of the next fragment, where `^\s*bool\s+` rejects it for the
# leading junk and the field is DELETED FROM THE COUNT. Exactly the #5727
# accessor failure, reached through `public:` and `#endif` instead — and just
# as silent, because nothing raises the depth and nothing throws.
#
# Both directions are live, and the growth one is the dangerous half: a bool
# added under an access label leaves the count EXACTLY at the freeze, so the
# ratchet prints "ok (shrink only)" while the population has actually grown.
# MAX_PLAUSIBLE_DROP cannot catch that, because nothing dropped.
#
# Handled by REMOVAL before the depth scan rather than by widening the field
# match, so a directive form nobody anticipated still cannot smuggle a field
# past — and so a stray brace inside `#define X {` can never collapse the scan.
#
# Comments are stripped over the WHOLE text: the previous per-physical-line
# `/\*.*?\*/` never matched a comment spanning lines, leaving its interior —
# a stray `{` included — visible to the depth tracking, and costing the next
# field even when the comment was perfectly balanced.
#
# STRING AND CHARACTER LITERALS GO IN THE SAME PASS (#5860 review, ten9876).
# The depth scan below sees a `{` wherever it occurs, so one inside a literal —
# `QStringLiteral("{")`, `char c = '{';` — raises the depth and never lowers
# it, and EVERY field after that point vanishes. Measured on today's header: a
# `"{"` literal placed anywhere after the 56th of the 71 bools loses 15 or
# fewer, which MAX_PLAUSIBLE_DROP cannot see; just below the 60th it costs 11.
# Silent, one-directional, and exactly the class this checker exists to close.
#
# ONE ALTERNATION AND NOT TWO ORDERED PASSES, deliberately. Whichever of the
# two runs first corrupts the other's input: literals first reads the `'` pair
# in `/* it's */ bool x = false; /* that's */` as a literal spanning the
# declaration and DELETES x (verified — a new loss, on a shape both the
# pre-#5727 parser and this one get right); comments first reads the `//` in
# `QStringLiteral("http://x")` as a comment and blanks the rest of that line.
# A single left-to-right scan has no order to get wrong: whichever construct
# STARTS first consumes the other, which is what a real lexer does.
#
# Blanked to a SPACE rather than to the match's own newlines. Nothing here
# reads a line number — the report names the file only — and preserving them
# split a directive that contained a multi-line block comment
# (`#define X /* a\n b */ 1`) into a live tail that ate the next field.
#
# NOT HANDLED: a raw string literal, `R"(…)"`. Its delimiters usually pair up
# by accident and it survives, but an odd number of interior `"` mis-pairs and
# an interior `{` goes live. A stated limitation, like `bool x(false)` below.
#
# A NUMBER IS ONE OF THE ALTERNATIVES (#5860 review, ten9876). Not because a
# number is non-code — `_blanked` keeps it — but because a C++14 digit
# separator is an apostrophe, and without a branch that claims it first the
# `'` in `1'000` opened a character literal that ran to the next apostrophe:
# the possessive in a trailing comment. Everything between was blanked, the
# `;` included, and the bool on the following line was DELETED from the count.
# `main`'s line parser counts it, so this was a regression in the quiet
# direction. Digit separators are already in this tree and this header already
# carries possessives in trailing comments; one rate limit written with a
# separator was all it would have taken. The `(?<![\w.])` lookbehind keeps a
# prefixed character literal (`u8'{'`) and the digits inside an identifier out

    # whole LINES whenever the depth entered or returned to 1, which meant a

    # `^\s*bool\s+` match below rejected it for the leading brace. The field
    # after an accessor was therefore DELETED FROM THE COUNT — silently, since
    # a one-line accessor never leaves depth 1 at all and the multi-line case
    # returns to it. Both failure directions are live: a bool declared after an
    # accessor vanishes and the ratchet reports a drop it then asks you to make
    # permanent, and a bool ADDED after one is never seen, so the population can
    # grow past the freeze with the count flat and MAX_PLAUSIBLE_DROP blind to
    # it because nothing dropped. The `std::optional<Record>` + accessor shape
    # this ratchet exists to ENCOURAGE is the shape that broke it.
    #
    # Two rules do it. Characters at depth >= 2 are dropped, so nothing inside a
    # member body, a brace initializer or a nested type can reach the field
    # match. And entering a FUNCTION BODY emits a synthetic `;`, which closes
    # off the declarator that opened it so the following field starts clean.
    #
    # A BODY ONLY, AND NOT EVERY BLOCK (#5860 review, ten9876). The first
    # revision of this fix emitted the synthetic `;` on every depth-1 `{`. That
    # truncated a brace-initialised comma declarator: `bool a{false}, b{true};`
    # scanned as `bool a; , b; ;` and `b` was deleted — invisible growth with
    # the count flat, which is the quiet direction this parser is supposed to
    # be the guard for, and a REGRESSION against the pre-#5727 line parser,
    # which counted both. No intent is needed to hit it; a house-style or
    # clang-format pass to brace initialisation introduces it silently.
    # `_opens_a_body()` tells the two apart on the fragment preceding the
    # brace. An initializer needs no terminator anyway: `agcModes = {…};`
    # scans as `QStringList agcModes = ;`, which fails the bool match, and the
