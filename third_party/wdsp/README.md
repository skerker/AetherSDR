# WDSP 2.10 vendor snapshot

This directory contains the WDSP sources used by AetherSDR's engine-side radio
DSP path. It is deliberately isolated behind `aether::wdsp`; no GUI target or
public AetherSDR header includes WDSP headers.

## Provenance

- Upstream: <https://github.com/TAPR/OpenHPSDR-wdsp>
- Upstream revision: `b02d5bac675dd2f33ec2bab2b339f79a597c47dd`
- Upstream commit subject: `Release Version 2.10`
- Imported path: `wdsp 2.10/Source/*.[ch]`
- License: GPL-2.0-or-later; see `LICENSE`

The revision is also recorded in `COMMIT`. The upstream PDF guide and the
runtime `Source/calculus` binary table are intentionally omitted: AetherSDR's
source-only contribution gate rejects binary additions, and neither artifact is
required for the initial RX chain. The source that optionally reads `calculus`
therefore retains its upstream fallback behavior.

## Local boundary

`upstream/` matches that source snapshot except for the local changes
recorded in `AETHERSDR-PATCHES.md`. The WFM integration adds patch 14: live
paired deemphasis, lock-free stereo observation, complete decoder reset, and
opt-in phase-difference/DC corrections that preserve stereo separation.
Patch 15 prepares depth-8 exchange rings only for nonblocking opt-in WFM,
retains legacy depth 2, and publishes copied output before its ring credit.
Its fixed memory/latency costs and deterministic tests are in the patch registry.
Existing WDSP overlap-save RF filtering is exposed
through the narrow C facade without changing the vendor filter. All portability
changes live outside it:

- `port/` implements the narrow Windows compatibility surface WDSP uses on
  Unix: threads, mutexes, semaphores/events, atomic operations, aligned
  allocation, exports, diagnostics, and flush-to-zero SIMD state.
- `include/aether_wdsp.h` is the only C API AetherSDR code may include.
- `CMakeLists.txt` builds a position-independent static archive, suppresses
  warnings only for vendored code, and force-includes `port/include/wdsp_port.h`
  on non-Windows targets. That last part is load-bearing: 2.10's
  `extrapolate.c`, `nurbs_fit.c` and `nurbs_spline.c` call `_aligned_malloc()`
  and `_aligned_free()` without including `comm.h`, which resolves to the CRT
  on MSVC and to nothing at all anywhere else.

## Neural Noise Reduction model data

`upstream/nnr_model_0.c` and `upstream/nnr_model_1.c` are 34.7 MB of generated C
holding the two trained NNR networks: `const unsigned char` blobs of 2,098,944
and 4,682,240 bytes, which `nnio_parse()` expands into `double` tensors at load.
They are vendored exactly as upstream ships them, which keeps the snapshot
verifiable and means no model file has to be packaged alongside the executable.

Every NNR construction looks for `wdsp_nnr_0.bin` and `wdsp_nnr_1.bin` **in the
process's working directory** and prefers either over the built-in copy for that
slot. The working directory, not the executable's: `nnet.c` holds those names as
bare relative paths and `nnio_open()` hands them straight to `fopen()`, and
upstream's own fallback message says "in the working directory" even though the
Guide describes it as the directory containing the executable. That is how an
experimental model reaches a tester without a rebuild, and AetherSDR keeps that
behaviour deliberately (RFC #5684 §8). Know what it costs, measured against a
standalone NNR:

| File present as `wdsp_nnr_0.bin` | Result |
|---|---|
| none | built-in loads; noise attenuation −28.15 dB |
| malformed | rejected, falls back to the built-in; −28.15 dB |
| another valid model | **loads it** — slot 0 ran the Premium network while the selector still read "Standard" |
| valid, different dimensions | **"passing audio through"** — NNR silently does nothing; −5.46 dB, which is only the resampling band limit |

The last row is the one that will be mistaken for a bug: a well-formed model from
a different WDSP release, left in a launch directory, disables NNR entirely. The
only trace is WDSP's own `dprintf`, which reaches `stderr` here — so a terminal
launch shows it and a desktop launch discards it. `SetNNRModelPathSlot(slot, "")`
skips the lookup for that slot and pins it to the built-in, if a host ever wants
to close it off.

Do not patch `upstream/` casually. Every unavoidable source change must be
recorded in `AETHERSDR-PATCHES.md` with the upstream revision, rationale, and
refresh instructions.

## Refresh procedure

1. Resolve the intended upstream revision to a full 40-character commit SHA.
2. Replace only `upstream/*.[ch]` from the matching release directory.
3. Update `COMMIT`, this file, and `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES`.
4. Build on macOS, Windows, and Linux and run `wdsp_channel_test`.
5. Confirm the audio callback allocation assertion and lifecycle leak checks.
