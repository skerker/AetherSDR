	// treatment if it does." It has surfaced.
	//
	// flushChannel() DOES have a handshake — upstream's, in destroy_iobuffs().
	// It is simply on the wrong side of destroy_main(). CloseChannel() is
	// pre_main_destroy(); destroy_main(); post_main_destroy(), and

	// underneath it. Running the handshake here, before destroy_main(), is the
	// whole fix; quiesce_flush() is idempotent so destroy_iobuffs() keeps its
	// call and simply finds the work already done.
	//
	// AFTER the worker wait above, not before, and the order is deliberate:
	// flushChannel() takes csDSP, which the worker holds across dexchange(), so
	// quiescing the flush thread first could make this function wait out the
	// worker's block through a second thread. With the worker already gone, both
	// channel sections are free and nothing can be holding them — the host is

			// fexchange0/fexchange2: upflag gates the input (upslew0/upslew2), downflag
			// gates the output (downslew0/downslew2). A stop sets downflag; the ramp only
			// advances when the host clocks fexchange*. So stop-then-start before the host
			// has clocked the ramp to completion leaves downflag set on a channel whose
			// state is now 1, and the next few blocks finish the stale ramp. That is not
			// merely a cosmetic fade on a running channel: the completion arm of
			// downslew0/downslew2 in iobuffs.c does
			//     InterlockedBitTestAndReset (&ch[channel].exchange, 0);
			// so it CLEARS EXCHANGE. Every later fexchange* then fails its opening
			// `if (exchange)` test and returns having written nothing and reported no
			// error, while ch[channel].state still reads 1. The channel is silently dead
			// until it is closed and rebuilt, and no flag a host can read says so.
			//
			// The asymmetry is the whole point: only the DOWN flag's completion clears
			// exchange, so the mirror case (start, then stop with upflag still pending) is
			// harmless and needs nothing here.
			//
			// flush_slews() rather than a bare clear of downflag, because the flag is not
			// the whole of the ramp: slew.dstate/dcount are the state machine, and clearing
			// the flag alone would strand dstate mid-ramp (DOWNSLEW/ZERO with a live dcount)
			// for the NEXT stop to resume from. flush_slews() resets both directions, which
			// is also what we want for the up-ramp we are about to arm — a fresh fade-in
			// from BEGIN rather than a resume of whatever ustate held. It clears upflag too,
			// hence the ordering: flush first, arm second.
			//
			// Under csEXCH, for the same reason SetChannelTDelayUp/Down and
			// SetChannelTSlewUp/Down take it around their own flush_slews() calls:
			// slew.dstate/dcount are plain ints owned by fexchange*'s critical section, and
			// without the lock this cancel could interleave with an in-flight downslew that
			// then clears exchange after we have set it. Taking it also makes the whole of
			// case 1 atomic against fexchange*. No new lock-order edge: csEXCH is the
			// innermost of the two channel sections (flushChannel takes csDSP then csEXCH),
			// this takes no other lock inside it and does not wait, and the port maps
			// CRITICAL_SECTION to a RECURSIVE pthread mutex, so a host calling this from
			// inside its own fexchange* thread is safe.
			//
			// ch[channel].flushflag is deliberately NOT cleared. The flush request belongs
			// to the flushChannel thread, which is parked on Sem_Flush and can only be
			// released by a ramp that completes; the next genuine stop releases it and the
			// flag clears then. Clearing it here would not wake that thread, only lie to
			// the dmode-1 wait in case 0.
			//
			// AetherSDR patch 8 (K5PTB, PR #5628): CANCELLING THE RAMP IS NOT ENOUGH. The
			// flush_slews() below cancels a ramp that is still PENDING. It cannot cancel a
			// flush that a ramp which already COMPLETED has requested: at that completion
			// fexchange0/fexchange2 cleared exchange and released Sem_Flush
			// (iobuffs.c, the ReleaseSemaphore calls in each) and the flushChannel
			// thread is now runnable but may not have been
			// scheduled. It takes csDSP then csEXCH, flushes, and does
			//     InterlockedBitTestAndSet (&a->exec_bypass, 0);
			// (channel.c). Arm in that window and flushChannel sets exec_bypass AFTER this
			// case has cleared it, so wdspmain() skips dexchange()/xrxa() entirely
			// (main.c) and the worker produces nothing for a channel whose state reads 1.
			// MEASURED on this tree (macOS arm64, RelWithDebInfo), a stress probe that stops,
			// clocks N blocks at the 256/48 kHz cadence, starts with NO gap, and then asks
			// for audio. Non-blocking, spacings 0-10, 40 trials each: 42 of 440 dead — 24 at
			// spacing 3 and 18 at spacing 4, and ZERO at 0-2, which is the window inside the
			// ramp that flush_slews() below already covered. The ramp is exactly three
			// blocks long here (BEGIN 1 + DOWNSLEW ntdown+1 + ZERO out_size+1 = 739 samples
			// at out_size 256), so spacing 3 is the first spacing at which it COMPLETES, and
			// that is where this dies. A control that sleeps 20 ms before each start —
			// giving the flush thread its slot — is 0 of 440 over the same sweep.
			//
			// Blocking mode is worse: the same restart HANGS THE HOST FOREVER, 20 of 20 at
			// spacing 3. With exec_bypass set, wdspmain() never reaches dexchange(), so
			// Sem_OutReady is never released and fexchange2's
			//     if (a->bfo) WaitForSingleObject (a->Sem_OutReady, INFINITE);
			// never returns. Six thread samples of six separate stalls all showed that same
			// two-thread starvation — host parked in fexchange2 holding csEXCH, flushChannel
			// already finished and back on Sem_Flush, worker idle on Sem_BuffReady. A
			// three-way lock cycle (flushChannel holding csDSP and blocking on the csEXCH
			// the parked host holds, worker then blocking on csDSP) is reachable from the
			// same window on a different interleaving, but was not what any sample caught.
			//
			// So WAIT the flush out before arming. "exchange clear AND flushflag set" names
			// exactly the completed-ramp case and nothing else:
			//   - a ramp still pending leaves exchange SET, so this falls straight through
			//     to the flush_slews() cancel below, which is the right treatment for it;
			//   - case 0's dmode-1 timeout force-clears exchange AND flushflag together, so
			//     an abandoned ramp does not wait here either;
			//   - a freshly built channel has flushflag cleared by pre_main_build, so
			//     OpenChannel's start never waits;
			//   - every in-tree restore call (SetDSPBuffsize, SetDSPSamplerate, RXASetNC,
			//     TXASetNC) reaches case 1 only after its own SetChannelState(0,1), which
			//     leaves flushflag clear on both of its exits. None of them wait either.
			// The only caller that can reach this wait is a host that stopped with dmode 0
			// and clocked the ramp out, which is the case that was broken.
			//
			// OUTSIDE csEXCH, and that is load-bearing: flushChannel needs csEXCH to finish
			// and clear flushflag, so waiting while holding it would guarantee the timeout
			// instead of the flush. Waiting here cannot join the three-way cycle either,
			// because this thread holds NO channel lock while it waits, and the host cannot
			// be inside fexchange* on it — WdspChannel::setRunning() and open() both take
			// the control fence, which refuses while a processIq() callback is in flight.
			// Nothing that must run to satisfy this wait can be blocked by it: csDSP is
			// never held across an unbounded wait (dexchange() only memcpys and releases),
			// and flush_iobuffs()'s Sem_BuffReady drain is a 1 ms-timeout poll.
			//
			// BOUNDED by the same count/timeout as case 0, for the same reason patch 4
			// bounds its handshake: a flush thread that never runs must not hang a start
			// forever. Falling through after the cap leaves exactly today's behaviour, no
			// worse. Cost of the wait, measured over 132 starts across spacings 0-10:
			// setRunning(true) mean 251 us, max 3.1 ms, against mean 0.83 us / max 3.1 us
			// with this block reverted. It is 0 in every path listed above; the ~3 ms is
