# AetherSDR patches to vendored QGeoView 1.1.0

Upstream: https://github.com/AmonRaNet/QGeoView (tag 1.1.0, LGPL-3.0).
The `demo/` and `samples/` trees and `.github/` are dropped from the vendored
copy. The library is otherwise pristine except for the patches below — keep
this list current when updating the snapshot.

1. **`lib/CMakeLists.txt`** — `add_library(qgeoview SHARED)` → `STATIC`, and
   the private `QGV_EXPORT` define is replaced by a public empty
   `QGV_LIB_DECL=` so no DLL export/import decoration is emitted.

2. **`lib/src/QGVLayerTilesOnline.cpp`** — removed the hardcoded fake
   MSIE User-Agent (the OSM tile usage policy documents browser
   impersonation as a blocking offense) and the
   `QSslSocket::VerifyNone` peer-verification bypass. Tile requests now
   send `QGV::getTileUserAgent()` and use default TLS verification.

3. **`lib/include/QGeoView/QGVGlobal.h` / `lib/src/QGVGlobal.cpp`** — added
   `QGV::setTileUserAgent()` / `QGV::getTileUserAgent()` so the application
   can install its app-identifying UA (AetherSDR sets
   `AetherSDR/<version> (https://github.com/aethersdr/AetherSDR)`).

4. **`lib/src/QGVLayerOSM.cpp`** — default tile URL templates switched from
   `http://{a,b,c}.tile.openstreetmap.org` to
   `https://tile.openstreetmap.org` (subdomain aliases are deprecated by
   OSM and plain HTTP redirects anyway).

5. **`QGVGlobal`, `QGVMapQGView`, and the tile layers** — added optional
   horizontal world repetition (`setHorizontalWrapEnabled()`, off by default,
   so an unpatched caller behaves exactly as upstream). The camera keeps
   projection x continuous across the antimeridian — `QGVMapQGView` slides the
   scene rect to follow it rather than wrapping the coordinate — while logical
   tile x repeats and `QGV::wrapTileX()` maps it back onto the canonical XYZ
   range so network URLs and the HTTP cache never see the repetition.
   `wrapTileX` is used by the tile layer only; the camera does not need it.
   `QGVLayerTilesOnline` also gained a bounded decoded-image cache, so
   re-entering an area costs a memcpy instead of a fetch and a PNG decode.

6. **`lib/src/QGVMapQGView.cpp`** — normalized wheel and high-resolution
   touchpad zoom to one symmetric exponential curve. Upstream's asymmetric
   in/out exponents (`2^(1/2)` in, `2^(1/1.5)` out) meant equal numbers of
   notches in and out did not return the operator to the scale they started
   from — a mouse wheel lost about 11% of scale per in/out round trip.
   Magnitudes, for the record: for a mouse wheel, zoom-**in** is numerically
   identical to upstream (`2^(delta/240)`) and zoom-**out** is ~19% gentler
   (`0.707x` per notch instead of `0.630x`). The high-resolution path changes
   more — upstream fed `pixelDelta` through the same `/120` divisor and the
   same asymmetric exponents, so `kTrackpadPixelsPerDoubling = 120.0` makes
   trackpad zoom-in exactly **2x faster per pixel** than upstream.
   `map_wrap_test` pins the round-trip property.

7. **`lib/src/QGVGlobal.cpp` — `GeoTilePos::parent()` floors instead of
   truncating.** Upstream divides two `int`s and calls `qFloor` on the
   already-truncated quotient, which rounds toward zero. That is only
   reachable once patch 5 makes tile x negative in the world copy west of the
   base one, and `contains()` is built on `parent()`, so the truncated form
   reported a western-copy tile as a child of a base-world tile.
   `removeWhenCovered()` counts coverage through `contains()`, so it would
   evict a fallback tile while the base world behind it was still half loaded —
   a blank hole at the antimeridian, i.e. exactly the symptom patch 5 exists
   to remove. Identical results for x >= 0. Pinned in `map_wrap_test`.

8. **`lib/src/QGVLayerTiles.cpp` — off-screen tiles are culled at every zoom
   level, not just the current one.** Upstream culls only `mCurZoom` against
   the active rect; tiles at the retained neighbouring zoom levels are removed
   solely by coverage or by zoom distance. That was safe while tile x was
   clamped to `[0, 2^zoom]`, because the set was finite by construction. With
   patch 5 it is not: every world copy the camera crossed left behind another
   band of fallback tiles that nothing ever reclaimed. `overlapsActiveRect()`
   adds the positional test, and it runs only when wrap is enabled.

9. **`lib/src/QGVLayerTilesOnline.cpp` — in-flight requests are keyed on the
   canonical tile.** Upstream keys `mRequest` on the position it was asked
   for; with patch 5 the several visible copies of one tile all resolve to the
   same canonical URL, so that would issue one identical concurrent GET per
   copy. The finished reply is now fanned out to every copy waiting on it.

10. **`lib/src/QGVMapQGView.cpp` — native trackpad pinch zoom.** Qt delivers
    macOS and Wayland trackpad pinches as incremental `ZoomNativeGesture`
    events rather than wheel events. The view now applies every fractional
    scale delta directly, without animation or integer zoom-level snapping,
    and keeps the projected point beneath the pinch centroid fixed. Both the
    view and viewport delivery paths are covered because `QGraphicsView`
    input targeting differs by platform.

11. **`lib/src/QGVMapQGView.cpp` — optional vertical camera bounds.**
    `setVerticalBoundsEnabled()` constrains the camera centre so the viewport
    cannot move beyond the projection's north or south edge during pan, zoom,
    or resize. It is off by default, preserving upstream behavior for callers
    that do not opt in; AetherSDR enables it for the PSK Reporter map.

12. **`lib/src/QGVLayerTiles.cpp` — coalesced tile-set bookkeeping during
    camera gestures.** Existing tile graphics continue to follow the view
    transform immediately, while the comparatively expensive active-tile-set
    rebuild waits until camera input has been idle for 100 ms. Unlike patch 8,
    this applies with or without horizontal wrapping. A continuous slow pan
    can therefore defer newly required tile loads until the gesture pauses;
    this is deliberate so tile scene churn does not stall map interaction.

13. **Online-tile readiness.**
    `QGVLayerTilesOnline` exposes pending, decoded-delivery, and failed-request
    counters so an overlay can retain its current frame until replacement
    coverage has actually loaded, and retry failed detail tiles.
    `QGVLayerTiles::retryUnfinishedTiles()` explicitly re-requests current-view
    null placeholders. An ordinary update skips unchanged cameras and cannot
    retry those indexed failures. Completed coverage is retained; online
    request coalescing still applies. Radar opts in with bounded retry delays.
    Intentional cancellations do not count as failures. Encoded-size aborts
    are marked before aborting and do count; retiring a reply disconnects its
    layer callbacks, and stale completions cannot remove a newer request.
    The socket-free `map_tile_reply_test` covers cleanup, direct cancellation,
    size-limit aborts, timeouts, and same-tile requests in a new generation.

14. **`lib/src/QGVMapQGItem.cpp` — direct image painting on OpenGL viewports.**
    `QGVImage` wrappers use `NoCache` when attached to an OpenGL-backed view.
    Qt's GL painter can retain each original image as a texture; the upstream
    device-coordinate cache instead creates scaled CPU pixmaps which thrash
    the shared cache at HiDPI during radar animation. Raster views and vector
    items retain the upstream mode. `map_image_cache_test` exercises real item
    attachment, unchanged source identity/resolution, and those exclusions.

15. **Transparent zoom fallback (opt-in).** `QGVLayerTiles` exposes
    `setTransparentFallbackEnabled()` and the undelivered footprint of retained
    tiles. `QGVLayerTilesOnline` clips fallback tiles to that footprint while
    painting: a completed higher-resolution tile replaces its entire footprint,
    including transparent pixels, rather than revealing old rain beneath it.
    Pending/failed descendants keep their fallback. Clipping uses const index
    lookup without a per-paint level-map copy. Radar opts in and retains three
    adjacent zoom levels; ordinary opaque basemap layers do not opt in.
    Parent retirement also counts `4^zoomDelta` descendants, not
    `2^(zoomDelta+1)`: eight of sixteen grandchildren cannot replace a parent.
    `weather_radar_loading_test` injects real QGeoView tile deliveries without
    sockets and covers missing descendants, transparent replacement and zoom out.

16. **Current tile coverage readiness.** `currentTilesComplete()` checks the
    selected viewport after coalesced camera processing, including undelivered
    placeholders. Radar readiness can acknowledge an unchanged completed tile
    set after a small pan without requiring another decoded tile.
