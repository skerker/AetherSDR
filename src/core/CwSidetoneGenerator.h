// driven by RadioModel::sendCwKey() / sendCwPaddle() events.
//
// Why client-side?  The radio's own sidetone (audio_mute=1 + DAX feed)
// has 30–100 ms of round-trip latency — fine for slow CW, brutal at
// 25+ WPM.  This generator runs in the audio thread alongside the
// existing buffer mix in AudioEngine, so the operator hears the tone
// within one audio callback (~10 ms) of pressing the key.
//
// All parameter setters use std::atomic so the UI thread can update
// pitch / volume / enable live without locking the audio thread.
// process() is the only method called on the audio thread.
