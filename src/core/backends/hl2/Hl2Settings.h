//   spanMhz — the panadapter span the operator last chose, in MHz.
//
// WHY THE SPAN IS PERSISTED. On this radio the pan span IS the DDC sample
// rate, so it is not a free display choice: the widest span costs ~8x the
// narrowest in network bandwidth (25.2 vs 3.1 Mbps sustained UDP, 3048 vs 381
// packets/second) and 8x the samples through WDSP's decimation front end.
//
// That rules out defaulting to the widest — it would impose the cost on every
// operator at connect, including on wifi and on hosts that cannot carry it.
// But defaulting to the narrowest with no memory is the bug this whole change
// exists to fix: the operator would be back to a 48 kHz window on every launch.
//
// Persisting resolves both. First run is the cheap default; an operator who
// wants the wide view chooses it once and keeps it, and the cost is opted into
// rather than imposed.
