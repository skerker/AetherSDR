# Windows Store MSIX Packaging

This document tracks the command-line MSIX path for AetherSDR. The goal is to
reuse the existing Windows `deploy` directory, then add the package identity,
manifest, visual assets, signing, and Store upload wrapper around it.

## Current Build Path

1. Build `AetherSDR.exe` with MSVC.
2. Run `windeployqt` into `deploy`.
3. Copy third-party DLLs and the MSVC runtime DLLs into `deploy`.
4. Run `packaging/windows/create-msix.ps1`.

The script creates `msix-root/`, writes `AppxManifest.xml`, generates package
icons from `docs/assets/logo-circle.png`, adds App Installer UX metadata, runs
`makeappx.exe`, optionally omits loose DFNR model payloads for Store readiness,
optionally signs the MSIX with `signtool.exe`, and optionally creates a
`.msixupload` archive for Partner Center.

Windows DFNR builds embed the DeepFilterNet model payload in Qt resources by
default (`AETHER_EMBED_DFNR_MODEL=ON`). At runtime, AetherSDR extracts that
payload to writable app-local data as `DeepFilterNet3_onnx.dfmodel` because the
DeepFilter C API requires a filesystem path. This keeps DFNR available in Store
MSIX builds without packaging a loose `DeepFilterNet3_onnx.tar.gz` file.

Development package:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command ". 'C:\Users\patj\Documents\AetherSDR\scripts\enter-msvc.ps1' -Arch x64; & '.\packaging\windows\create-msix.ps1' -DeployDir deploy -OutputDir . -CreateUpload -SkipSign"
```

Store identity package:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command ". 'C:\Users\patj\Documents\AetherSDR\scripts\enter-msvc.ps1' -Arch x64; . '.\packaging\windows\store-identity.ps1'; & '.\packaging\windows\create-msix.ps1' -DeployDir deploy -OutputDir . -CreateUpload -SkipSign -ExcludeDfnrModel"
```

## Manifest Values

Values we can automate:

- `Identity.Version`: read from `project(AetherSDR VERSION ...)` and normalized
  to four MSIX components, such as `26.5.3.0`.
- `Identity.ProcessorArchitecture`: `x64` for the current Windows build.
- `Application.Executable`: `AetherSDR.exe`.
- `TargetDeviceFamily`: `Windows.Desktop`, currently Windows 10 build 19041+
  because the manifest uses `uap10:RuntimeBehavior`.
- Visual assets: generated from the existing AetherSDR logo.

Partner Center Store package values:

- `Identity.Name`: `AetherSDR.AetherSDR`
- `Identity.Publisher`: `CN=E03F94A2-AEAB-46D2-8BF1-6419C305CC44`
- `PublisherDisplayName`: `AetherSDR`

These values are in `packaging/windows/store-identity.ps1`. The file only sets
variables that are currently unset, so CI repository variables or local shell
environment variables can still override them for testing.

Values that need maintainer choice:

- Short manifest description:
  `Multi-platform SDR client for FlexRadio transceivers (6000/8600/Aurora).`
- Capability disclosure comfort:
  - `runFullTrust`: required for a packaged classic desktop app.
  - `internetClient`: needed for SmartLink, release metadata, propagation data,
    and other internet-backed features.
  - `internetClientServer` is intentionally not declared. It does not create a
    Windows Firewall exception for this medium-IL packaged desktop helper.
  - `privateNetworkClientServer`: needed for LAN radio/peripheral TCP and UDP.
  - `microphone`: recommended because AetherSDR captures PC mic audio for TX.
- Desktop extension disclosure:
  - [`windows.firewallRules`](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/desktop-to-uwp-extensions):
    adds an all-profile inbound UDP exception scoped to
    `aether-dv-waveform.exe`. Windows owns the packaged rule lifecycle, so
    package installation and updates retain it and package removal deletes it
    without a separate elevation prompt.

## Automation Plan

Already automatable:

- Local MSIX creation from the existing Windows deploy folder.
- CI artifact creation after the current `windeployqt` deployment step.
- Store identity injection from `packaging/windows/store-identity.ps1`, with
  optional GitHub repository variable overrides.
- Signing from GitHub secrets when a development/test PFX exists.
- `.msixupload` creation for Partner Center, with bundled `.appxsym` debug
  symbols for crash decoding (see below).

Not fully automatable until account setup:

- Final Store submission unless Partner Center API credentials are created and
  stored as secrets.

## Debug Symbols (.appxsym / PDB)

Microsoft Store crash reports in Partner Center only resolve to a symbolized
stack trace if the submitted `.msixupload` carries matching debug symbols.
There is no separate "upload symbols" step in Partner Center — the symbols
travel *inside* the upload package as a `.appxsym` file (a zip of PDBs), which
Partner Center ingests with the submission.

The Windows installer workflow produces this automatically:

1. **Configure** builds with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`, not
   `Release`. Plain MSVC `Release` does not emit `/Zi`/`/DEBUG`, so
   `build/AetherSDR.pdb` would never exist. `RelWithDebInfo` keeps the same
   `-O2` optimization level (only the inliner threshold, `/Ob1` vs. `/Ob2`,
   differs) while producing a full PDB.
2. The Qt install includes the base `debug_info` archive plus each deployed
   add-on's `.debug_information` companion. `windeployqt --pdb` copies PDBs
   only for the exact Qt DLLs and plugins selected for the runtime payload.
3. `stage-debug-symbols.ps1` verifies that every deployed Qt DLL/plugin has
   its same-named PDB beside it. It then moves those PDBs out of `deploy/` and
   flattens them beside `AetherSDR.pdb` in `symbols/`. This is important:
   `deploy/` feeds the portable ZIP, Inno installer, and MSIX, none of which
   should ship PDB payload files.
4. `create-msix.ps1 -CreateUpload -RequirePdb` consumes the staged application
   PDB and dependency PDBs. Pass `-PdbPath symbols\AetherSDR.pdb` and
   `-SymbolDir symbols` so both inputs describe the same verified symbol set.
   The script places the PDBs at the root of `<package>.appxsym`, then places
   that `.appxsym` beside the `.msix` at the root of `<package>.msixupload`.
   This mirrors Visual Studio's single-architecture Store upload layout; there
   is no extra `symbols/` directory inside either archive. Microsoft documents
   the outer upload/symbol relationship in its
   [MSIX package requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/publish/publish-your-app/msix/app-package-requirements),
   and a Microsoft WinUI engineer's
   [manual packaging walkthrough](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/discussions/9121)
   shows all PDBs for one architecture together in one flat `.appxsym`.
5. `check-symbol-package.ps1` opens both archives and verifies the topology,
   required AetherSDR/Qt/Windows Multimedia PDBs, and that the `.appxsym`
   embedded in `.msixupload` is byte-identical to the verified standalone
   file.
6. CI uploads the complete `symbols/` directory as **Windows-Symbols** with a
   SHA-256 manifest (90-day retention), and uploads the standalone `.appxsym`
   alongside the other Windows-Installer artifacts. Maintainers therefore get
   the same AetherSDR and Qt PDB set for local WinDbg/Visual Studio debugging
   without unpacking a `.msixupload`. On a tag, the same set plus the waveform
   helper's PDB is also attached to the release as
   `AetherSDR-vX.Y.Z-Windows-x64-symbols.tar.xz`, which does not expire
   ([debugging-crashes.md](debugging-crashes.md)).

The Qt-provided PDBs are packaged unchanged. `windeployqt` selects them from
the same exact Qt installation that supplied the deployed DLLs; `pdbcopy` is
not needed to discover or match them. If Partner Center later requires
public-only/stripped copies, that can be added as a separate transformation
without changing this archive topology. Store acceptance alone does not prove
that third-party Qt symbols were indexed, so confirm the first qualifying
Health report for this package version resolves Qt function names rather than
only `Qt6*.dll+offset`.

Submitting the `.msixupload` to Partner Center (manually today, or via the
automated draft-staging flow below) is the only "publish" step needed —
Partner Center decodes future crash stacks against the bundled `.appxsym`
automatically, with no further action required.

### Symbolizing a crash dump (macOS / Linux)

You don't need Windows or WinDbg to symbolize a reporter's crash. The
[`rust-minidump`](https://github.com/rust-minidump/rust-minidump) toolchain
works cross-platform against the same PDB:

1. **Get the reporter's dump.** Enable a Windows Error Reporting minidump
   (`DumpType=1`) using the instructions and privacy notes in
   [debugging-crashes.md](debugging-crashes.md#for-users-what-to-attach-to-the-issue);
   it lands in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CrashDumps\AetherSDR.exe.<pid>.dmp`. A full
   dump (`DumpType=2`) holds all of the process's memory, so ask for one only
   privately, for a crash a minidump cannot explain. Store Partner Center TSVs
   are unsymbolized — request the `.dmp`.
2. **Get the matching PDBs** — they must be from the *exact* build that crashed
   or the debug-ids won't match. For a release, download its symbol archive:
   `gh release download vX.Y.Z -R aethersdr/AetherSDR -p '*-Windows-x64-symbols.tar.xz'`
   and extract it with `tar -xJf`. For a branch build, or a release older than
   those archives, pull the `Windows-Symbols` artifact from that
   `windows-installer.yml` run within its 90 days:
   `gh run download <run-id> -R aethersdr/AetherSDR -n Windows-Symbols`.
3. **Convert + walk.** [`dump_syms`](https://github.com/mozilla/dump_syms)
   turns each needed PDB into a Breakpad `.sym`; `minidump-stackwalk` walks
   the dump and matches modules by debug-id:
   ```sh
   dump_syms --store ./symbols AetherSDR.pdb          # → symbols/AetherSDR.pdb/<id>/AetherSDR.sym
   dump_syms --store ./symbols Qt6Multimedia.pdb      # matching Qt frames
   minidump-stackwalk --human --symbols-path ./symbols \
     --symbols-url https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols \
     AetherSDR.exe.<pid>.dmp
   ```
   AetherSDR and packaged Qt frames symbolize from those `.sym` files; the
   `--symbols-url` resolves Windows system DLLs. Other third-party GPU/driver
   frames (e.g. Intel `igd10iumd64.dll`) stay as `module+offset` — usually
   enough, since the value is in our caller frames leading into the driver. If
   the crashing thread won't unwind past a driver frame (no CFI), fall back to
   a manual stack scan: parse the dump's `Memory64ListStream`, find the region
   containing the thread's `rsp`, and scan 8-byte-aligned values for pointers
   into `AetherSDR.exe` (resolve offsets against the `.sym` `FUNC` table).

## Known WACK Follow-Ups

The Windows App Certification Kit currently gives useful Store-readiness
signals, but some findings need follow-up before final submission:

- `Blocked executables`: AetherSDR shells out to PowerShell for Windows support
  bundle ZIP creation. Replace that path with in-process ZIP creation.
- `Archive files usage`: Windows DFNR builds embed the model payload in Qt
  resources and do not deploy a loose `DeepFilterNet3_onnx.tar.gz` file. The
  `-ExcludeDfnrModel` switch remains as a packaging safety net for older deploy
  directories or custom builds with loose DFNR payloads.
- `DPIAwarenessValidation`: AetherSDR.exe now embeds a PerMonitorV2 desktop
  app manifest, and the Windows installer workflow verifies the deployed
  executable before MSIX packaging. WACK 10.0.26100.7705 reports
  `DPIAwarenessValidation` as passing on the generated MSIX.
- Qt and vendor DLLs may still report process-launch imports or short blocked
  string matches. Treat those separately from app-owned launch behavior.

## GitHub Variables

The Windows installer workflow sources `packaging/windows/store-identity.ps1`
before building the MSIX artifact. These optional repository variables override
the checked-in defaults when set:

- `AETHERSDR_MSIX_IDENTITY_NAME`
- `AETHERSDR_MSIX_PUBLISHER`
- `AETHERSDR_MSIX_DISPLAY_NAME`
- `AETHERSDR_MSIX_PUBLISHER_DISPLAY_NAME`
- `AETHERSDR_MSIX_DESCRIPTION`
- `AETHERSDR_MSIX_BACKGROUND_COLOR`
- `AETHERSDR_MSIX_INSTALLER_ACCENT_COLOR`
- `AETHERSDR_MSIX_INSTALLER_BACKGROUND_COLOR`

If the identity variables are unset, CI now uses the checked-in Partner Center
identity defaults from `store-identity.ps1`.

## Automated Store Submission (weekly release cycle) — WIRED

> Status: **wired, dormant until credentials are set.** The `Windows Installer`
> workflow now stages a **draft** Store submission on every `v*` tag push, but
> the step is a no-op until the maintainer completes the one-time Entra /
> Partner Center setup below and sets the `AETHERSDR_STORE_PRODUCT_ID`
> repository variable. Until then the workflow behaves exactly as before
> (builds the `.msixupload`, attaches it to the release).

On a `v*` tag push the workflow:

1. Builds `AetherSDR.exe`, runs `windeployqt`, packages the MSIX, and creates
   the `.msixupload` (existing steps).
2. The pinned `microsoft/microsoft-store-apppublisher` action puts the pinned
   `msstore` CLI v0.4.2 on PATH and the workflow logs `msstore --version`.
3. `msstore reconfigure` authenticates from the four GitHub secrets.
4. `packaging/windows/publish-store.ps1` finds the `.msixupload` and runs
   `msstore publish <pkg>.msixupload -id <ProductId> --uploadTimeout 300
   --noCommit` — staging a **draft**. `--noCommit` is the safety gate that keeps
   it out of certification. A maintainer reviews the pending submission in
   Partner Center and clicks **Submit to Store** to start certification. **CI
   never publishes to the live channel on its own.**

Guard rails (all three must pass before Partner Center is touched):

- The step runs only on a `push` event for a `refs/tags/v*` ref. Manual
  dispatches, including those targeting a tag, never attach release assets or
  stage a production Store draft.
- The step is skipped unless the `AETHERSDR_STORE_PRODUCT_ID` **repository
  variable** is set — so the feature is dormant until you opt in.
- The publication plan requires the upstream `aethersdr/AetherSDR` repository;
  forks cannot select production publication even if they configure secrets.

If the MSIX packaging step (which is `continue-on-error`) produced no
`.msixupload`, `publish-store.ps1` warns and exits 0 rather than turning an
otherwise-successful release red.

The upload timeout is deliberately explicit, and stays that way — but it is no
longer a bug workaround. `msstore` CLI v0.4.0 and v0.4.1 had a regression where
omitting `--uploadTimeout` supplied a zero-second Azure blob network timeout,
producing the characteristic `Uploading Bundle to Azure blob: 0%` failure and
exit code `-1`
([microsoft/msstore-cli#162](https://github.com/microsoft/msstore-cli/issues/162)).
That is fixed by
[microsoft/msstore-cli#163](https://github.com/microsoft/msstore-cli/pull/163)
and released in v0.4.2, which the pin above now names, so omitting the option
would correctly yield the documented 100 s default.

300 seconds is kept because 100 s is genuinely too short for this package. The
CLI sets no `StorageTransferOptions`, so a `.msixupload` under 256 MiB is
uploaded as a **single PUT** and the network timeout has to cover the whole
transfer rather than an individual chunk. AetherSDR's upload is ~200 MB, which
at 100 s would demand a sustained ~2 MB/s for the entire request.

The workflow deliberately leaves verbose logging disabled because Actions logs
are public and expanded authentication or upload diagnostics could expose
derived credentials that GitHub cannot mask by their registered secret values.
The CLI stays pinned to prevent `latest` from silently changing publish
behavior.

### One-time setup (maintainer, outside the repo)

The `msstore` GitHub Actions path is currently supported for **free products
only**, which AetherSDR is. The app must already be published and live in the
Store — done via the manual `.msixupload`. **TL;DR:** create an Entra app
registration, give it the **Manager** role in Partner Center, then store four
secrets + one variable in GitHub.

0. **Individual accounts: create a free Entra tenant first.** An individual
   (personal-MSA) Partner Center account has no Entra/Azure AD tenant by
   default, but the submission API needs one. Partner Center → gear →
   Account settings → **Tenants** → **Create Microsoft Entra ID**. It's free,
   needs no paid Azure subscription, and the account owner already has the
   **Manager** role required to do it. Company accounts can skip this.

1. **Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) app registration** — this is the "service
   account" the CI uses to authenticate.
   - Register an app in Entra ID (`entra.microsoft.com` → **App registrations**
     → New registration) in the tenant from step 0. Single-tenant is fine; no
     redirect URI is needed for the client-credentials flow.
   - In Partner Center → Account settings → User management → *Microsoft Entra
     applications*, add that app and assign it the **Manager** role. (This is
     the step that actually authorizes the app to submit; the Entra
     registration alone is not enough.)
   - In the app registration → **Certificates & secrets** → New client secret,
     create a secret and copy the **value** immediately (it is shown once).

2. **Collect the four credential values + the product Id:**

   | What | Where to find it | Goes into GitHub as |
   |---|---|---|
   | **Tenant ID** | Entra admin center → Overview → Tenant ID | secret `AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID` |
   | **Client ID** | The app registration's *Application (client) ID* | secret `AZURE_AD_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID` |
   | **Client Secret** | The secret *value* from step 1 | secret `AZURE_AD_APPLICATION_SECRET` |
   | **Seller ID** | Partner Center → Account settings → Identifiers (a.k.a. Publisher/Seller ID) | secret `SELLER_ID` |
   | **Store product ID** | 12-char ID from the Partner Center product URL, or `msstore apps list` after a local `msstore reconfigure` | **variable** `AETHERSDR_STORE_PRODUCT_ID` |

3. **GitHub repo configuration** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):
   - Secrets (the four credentials above): `AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID`,
     `AZURE_AD_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_AD_APPLICATION_SECRET`,
     `SELLER_ID`.
   - Variable: `AETHERSDR_STORE_PRODUCT_ID` (the Store product ID). **Leaving
     this unset keeps the whole Store-submission step disabled** — set it last,
     once the four secrets are in place, to switch the automation on.

4. **First run.** Cut a release (or re-tag) so a `v*` tag pushes. Watch the
   *Stage Microsoft Store submission (draft)* step in the **Windows Installer**
   workflow, then confirm a new **draft** submission appears in Partner Center.
   Click **Submit to Store** there to start certification for the first
   automated build; later you can promote to fully automatic (see below).

### Version discipline

Microsoft Store [reserves the fourth version component for its own use](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/publish/publish-your-app/msix/app-package-requirements);
submitted packages must end in `.0`.

Production tag pushes use the source release version: `26.9.2` becomes
`26.9.2.0`, independent of the workflow run number and flight configuration.
The tag must name the same version as `project(AetherSDR VERSION ...)`;
`v26.9.2` and `v26.9.2.0` both match a `26.9.2` source. A nonzero CalVer
hotfix revision, unsupported Store patch, or mismatched/suffixed tag yields a
plan with `storeEligible = false`, an empty MSIX version and a run annotation
explaining why. MSIX creation, Store symbol-package validation and production
Store submission are skipped; the portable ZIP, Inno installer, debug-symbol
artifact and GitHub release attachment remain enabled. The planner never
substitutes another version for a release it cannot package.

Before uploading a production package, compare its version with the highest
production package accepted in Partner Center; Partner Center rejects a lower
version, and a package accepted under the earlier run-counter scheme outranks
every release-based version in the same month.

Development builds, including manual flights, retain `YY.M.<workflow run
number>.0`. Their run number must fit `1..65535`; that limit does not apply to
production because production does not use it. Rerunning a development workflow
reuses its version.

**Developer flights intentionally rank ahead of production.** A flight such
as `26.9.205.0` is higher than production `26.9.2.0`, so flight users keep
receiving flights; the next production patch does not supersede a flight for
them. Flight numbering is independent of production versioning.

Local `create-msix.ps1` builds also default to the normalized source version.
With `-CreateUpload`, a nonzero fourth component is rejected before staging
files; a CalVer hotfix is not Store-published by the workflow, so to upload one
by hand pass an explicit `-Version YY.M.BUILD.0` that is higher than the last
accepted package. The app's CalVer, portable ZIP, Inno installer and release
tags are unchanged by MSIX packaging.

### Promoting to fully automatic later

Production certification requires **both** `-Commit` and `-CommitProduction`
when invoking `publish-store.ps1`. `-Commit` alone is accepted only with a
nonempty explicit `-FlightId`; a missing flight ID fails before invoking the
CLI. `-CommitProduction` is rejected with a flight or without `-Commit`.
The production tag workflow passes neither switch and keeps the draft gate.

### Manually triggered developer package flight

The Windows Installer workflow can build any explicitly selected ref and fully
submit its `.msixupload` to an existing Partner Center developer package
flight. This path runs only through **Run workflow** when **Build and fully
submit this ref to the Microsoft Store developer flight** is selected. It has
no schedule and creates no Git tag or GitHub Release.

The manual flight path is isolated from production:

- production tag submissions retain `--noCommit` and remain drafts;
- the flight job runs only for an explicit `workflow_dispatch` request in the
  upstream `aethersdr/AetherSDR` repository;
- `AETHERSDR_STORE_FLIGHT_ID` is required and validated before building, then
  checked again before authentication; a missing flight ID fails the workflow
  rather than falling back to production;
- the flight ID is passed explicitly as `--flightId`, and `-Commit` omits
  `--noCommit`, so Partner Center starts ingestion/certification automatically;
- the shared publisher keeps `--verbose` disabled so the public flight log does
  not expand authentication or upload diagnostics.

Create the package flight and its known-user group in Partner Center first,
then add the flight ID as the repository Actions secret
`AETHERSDR_STORE_FLIGHT_ID`. Keep `AETHERSDR_STORE_PRODUCT_ID` pointed at the
existing production app; a flight is a restricted channel under that product,
not a second product identity.

Before the first CI upload, remove any pending submission that was created for
the flight in Partner Center. The Store CLI cannot upload into a portal-created
first draft because that draft has no API file-upload URL; the workflow must be
allowed to create the first API-backed submission itself. This is a one-time
flight setup concern, not part of the production submission path.

Expect the first dispatch to be the first real exercise of the Store CLI's
flight contract. The regression suite substitutes an in-process `msstore`
command, so it proves which arguments `publish-store.ps1` assembles but not
that the pinned CLI accepts `--flightId` on `publish`. A wrong option name
fails the step loudly rather than publishing anywhere, but budget for it —
along with credentials and certification — on the first attempt.

The flight uses the development MSIX sequence described under **Version discipline**
above. Production uses its source release version, remains a draft, and requires
maintainer action for certification.

The socket-free regression suite is `tests/windows_store_policy_test.ps1`:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tests\windows_store_policy_test.ps1
```

It exercises the actual build-plan script with tag/branch dispatches and the
publisher with an in-process CLI substitute. It performs no Store requests.
Windows Installer runs it before packaging; CTest registers
`windows_store_policy` when PowerShell is installed, for the unfiltered full
suite. It is not added to the frozen per-PR CTest gate. A passing test does not
prove Partner Center credentials, flight configuration, or Store certification;
verify those separately during the first intended flight publication.

Microsoft warns that an API-created flight submission must continue to be
managed through the API. Do not edit the in-progress submission in Partner
Center. The pinned Store CLI replaces an existing pending submission after the
flight has a published submission, and replaces a failed or expired API-created
first submission; it then commits and polls the new submission. After a
successful commit, Partner Center moves the flight through preprocessing,
certification, and publication to the flight's known-user group.

## Local Sideload Signing

Windows requires MSIX packages to be signed with a certificate that is trusted
on the machine installing the package. Unsigned packages, or packages signed by
an untrusted self-signed certificate, fail with errors such as `0x800B010A`.

For local development, create a certificate whose subject exactly matches the
development manifest publisher:

```powershell
$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate `
  -Type Custom `
  -Subject "CN=AetherSDR Development" `
  -FriendlyName "AetherSDR MSIX Development" `
  -KeyUsage DigitalSignature `
  -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" `
  -TextExtension @("2.5.29.37={text}1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3", "2.5.29.19={text}")

$password = Read-Host -AsSecureString "PFX password"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path packaging\windows\certs | Out-Null
Export-PfxCertificate -Cert $cert -FilePath packaging\windows\certs\aethersdr-msix-dev.pfx -Password $password
Export-Certificate -Cert $cert -FilePath packaging\windows\certs\aethersdr-msix-dev.cer
```

Trust the certificate on the test machine, then rebuild the package without
`-SkipSign`:

```powershell
Import-Certificate -FilePath packaging\windows\certs\aethersdr-msix-dev.cer -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\TrustedPeople
$env:AETHERSDR_MSIX_CERTIFICATE_FILE = "packaging\windows\certs\aethersdr-msix-dev.pfx"
$env:AETHERSDR_MSIX_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD = "<the PFX password>"
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command ". 'C:\Users\patj\Documents\AetherSDR\scripts\enter-msvc.ps1' -Arch x64; & '.\packaging\windows\create-msix.ps1' -DeployDir deploy -OutputDir . -CreateUpload"
```

Production Store packages should use Partner Center identity values. Packages
distributed through the Microsoft Store are signed by the Store during
submission, so this local self-signed certificate is only for sideload testing.

## Notes From Microsoft Docs

- [Manual MSIX packaging](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/desktop/desktop-to-uwp-manual-conversion)
  is manifest plus package components plus `MakeAppx.exe`.
- [MakeAppx.exe](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/package/create-app-package-with-makeappx-tool)
  creates `.msix` packages, but does not create `.msixupload` files for
  Partner Center; those are normally produced by Visual Studio or assembled
  manually.
- [Custom App Installer UX](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/app-installer/how-to-create-custom-app-installer-ux)
  uses `Msix.AppInstaller.Data/MSIXAppInstallerData.xml` under the package root.
- [Package identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/package-identity-overview)
  consists of name, version, architecture, resource ID, and publisher.
- [MSIX signing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/package/sign-msix-package-guide)
  requires the package certificate subject to match the manifest publisher; the
  Store signs submitted packages for Store distribution.
- [Desktop full-trust packages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/desktop-to-uwp-distribute)
  require Store approval for the `runFullTrust` restricted capability.
- The Store signs published packages with a trusted certificate, but local
  sideload testing still needs a package signed by a certificate trusted on the
  test machine.
