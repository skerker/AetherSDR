# PSK Reporter city lights

Enable **City lights** to overlay NASA/GSFC's historical 2016 VIIRS night-light
composite on the flat map or globe. This is historical imagery, not current
activity or an outage monitor. Some light sources are not cities.

With **Day/night** enabled, lights fade in smoothly between sunset and the end
of civil twilight (solar elevation 0 to -6 degrees). With Day/night disabled,
lights appear worldwide. The **City lights brightness** slider, shown when the
layer is enabled, adjusts intensity from 0 to 100 percent. Visibility defaults
to off; brightness defaults to 70 percent. **Faint lights** defaults to 50 percent and lifts dim settlements while preserving
black backgrounds, hue, and bright city centers. Zero restores the original
intensity mapping. **Warmth** defaults to 0, which keeps NASA's original
grayscale appearance; raising it tints lights golden. All preferences are saved in the
existing `PskReporter` settings object. The layer is independent of weather
radar and its playback clock; twilight always follows current UTC.

Lights appear above night shading, below radar, report paths and station
markers. OSM attribution remains visible alongside NASA attribution. Missing
imagery leaves the existing map usable; a compact status at the bottom of the map
reports loading and retries. Radar and city-light messages stack in the same
click-through notice, each disappearing independently. A short delay suppresses
city-light notices for quick cache hits. Closing the map or disabling lights stops requests
and the solar refresh timer. Previously decoded imagery remains available for
reuse when the map is reopened.

## Source and rendering contract

- Provider: NASA Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS), layer
  `VIIRS_Night_Lights`, fixed `TIME=2016-01-01`, PNG, EPSG:3857.
- Public WMS 1.1.1 GetMap endpoint:
  `https://gibs.earthdata.nasa.gov/wms/epsg3857/best/wms.cgi`.
  No account, key, or new package dependency is required.
- Verified against the live GIBS Web Mercator WMTS capabilities and a WMS
  sample on 2026-09-07. The dataset is available for 2012 and 2016; 2016 is
  selected explicitly. `GoogleMapsCompatible_Level8` bounds its native detail.
- Exports are debounced, padded and bounded to 4096 pixels per axis, with
  resolution capped at the layer's zoom-8 Web Mercator pixel size. Crossing
  the dateline uses a canonical full-width export, repeated in the flat map;
  that view can be less detailed than a regional export. The globe omits lights
  beyond the provider's +/-85.051129-degree latitude coverage.
- Both renderers consume imagery with immutable,
  north-positive EPSG:3857 bounds. Only the flat renderer reflects the Y axis.
- Although the PNG is a lights-only product, its land background can contain
  opaque black pixels. The display mapping preserves premultiplied RGB and
  replaces alpha with the maximum RGB channel, making black transparent and
  faint lights translucent. Brightness scales the resulting premultiplied
  image once. This is a visual overlay, not a calibrated radiance plot.
- The globe shares the radar implementation's premultiplied texture uploader
  and surface ordering. Its UV coordinates are derived per fragment from the
  geographic surface normal; no lights are projected onto the far hemisphere.
- Download limit: 16 MiB, 15-second timeout, one active HTTP request. PNG
  dimensions are checked before decoding. Failures retain the previous image
  and retry after 66 seconds (or later while the provider cooldown remains).
  The dedicated HTTP disk cache is bounded to 64 MiB and follows response cache
  headers. CPU image work uses the existing Qt global worker pool, with at most
  one twilight-mask job plus a coalesced follow-up.

This feature builds on weather radar support merged in PR #5477. The optional controls and
rendering choices are subject to maintainer design review before merging.

The detail enhancement uses an independently designed gamma curve on light
coverage, before twilight and overall brightness. The globe keeps the original
image resident on the GPU and applies enhancement and twilight in its fragment
shader. Slider changes update a uniform and repaint, without CPU image work or
texture uploads. The flat view uses the CPU image path. Both paths take their
gamma span, warmth coefficients, twilight depth and control defaults from
`src/gui/map/CityLightsShading.h`, and the globe shader is generated from those
constants, so the projections cannot drift apart. OpenHamClock was used only
as a public visual reference; no implementation code was inspected or copied.
The larger export budget improves Retina detail; full-world/date-line exports
remain less detailed than regional views and are not a tiled renderer.

Warmth is a saved display preference (default 0 percent). Zero preserves the
grayscale NASA lights; increasing it adds a warm-white to golden tint without
changing opacity. It does not represent measured lamp color. The globe applies
warmth as a shader uniform without uploading a new image; the flat map applies
the same channel scaling in its CPU image worker.

cooldowns, `Retry-After` handling, recovery probes, and the limits of this protection.
