# RTL slice persistence foundation (RFC #5468, F3a)

This change separates reported USB identity from discovery's connection locator.
`RadioModel::settingsScope()` supplies the same identity for its current
OperatingState save and preconnect/retry restore: trimmed reported RTL serial,
or the RTL family-wide row when no serial was reported. Genuine numeric serials
remain identities. Duplicate real serials still share a row; an index locator
does not distinguish their persistent state. Other families retain their existing
scope. RTL disconnect/flush completes under the old scope before a session swap.
Backend metadata no longer fabricates a serial from an enumeration index.

## Identity changes and existing saved state

The family-row choice follows the maintainer's
[RFC #5468 approval](https://github.com/aethersdr/AetherSDR/issues/5468#issuecomment-5563734720)
and section 1.1 of the accepted RFC. It deliberately permits shared saved state:

- A dongle with no reported serial writes the RTL family row. Other anonymous
  dongles read and overwrite that same row, regardless of their USB index.
- A dongle with a reported serial but no exact saved row also reads that family
  row. For example, saving an anonymous dongle at 100.1 MHz WFM means a previously
  unseen identified dongle restores that saved frequency, mode, passband, rate
  and RF gain. Once the identified dongle saves its own exact row, that row takes
  precedence over the family row.
- Duplicate nonempty reported serials use the same exact row and overwrite each
  other's saved state. Discovery may need an index locator to connect the second
  dongle, but retains its actual reported serial; it does not turn that serial
  into an empty identity. Persistent per-dongle isolation is not claimed.

Existing unique reported serials keep their scope, including genuine numeric
serials. The affected old scopes are locator-keyed rows such as `rtl:0` for an
anonymous dongle or `rtl:1` for an index-selected duplicate. These rows are
preserved in the database, but an anonymous or duplicate session now selects
the family row or the reported-serial row respectively. No old locator-keyed
`OperatingState` is moved, merged, deleted, or imported into `RtlSlices`; a USB
index cannot establish which physical dongle owned it.

**Upgrade consequence:** when only the old locator-keyed state exists and there
is no applicable reported-serial or family row, the first connection receives
empty restored state and starts with the backend's defaults. This is a one-time
reset of saved tuning, mode, passband, rate and RF gain until new state is saved
under the selected scope. If a family row already exists, its state is restored
instead. A duplicate can instead inherit the original dongle's existing
reported-serial row. The old rows remain as an orphaned downgrade snapshot; this
change provides no migration from them and no automatic per-dongle recovery.

Review feedback proposed a separate anonymous index namespace or disabling
anonymous persistence to prevent family sharing. Those are policy changes to
the explicitly approved identity rule. F3a retains that rule and documents/tests
its consequences; it does not claim to eliminate cross-device fallback.

## Band Stack bookmarks

Band Stack uses the same model scope. A connected anonymous RTL radio explicitly
marks that scope as an anonymous identity, so manual and automatic bookmarks can
read and write the RTL family row. An ordinary empty-ID scope remains unknown
and is refused; a disconnected anonymous model does not grant bookmark access.
Identified radios retain exact-row bookmark reads and writes (Band Stack does
not adopt OperatingState's family fallback). Anonymous dongles share their
bookmark row; duplicate reported serials share their exact bookmark row.

Old locator-keyed Band Stack documents remain intact but unclaimed, just like
the old OperatingState documents. No USB index can prove which dongle owns them.
Anonymous bookmark access never imports a legacy side-file section, and this
change provides no automatic recovery of ambiguous old bookmarks.

## RtlSlices owner and staged cutover

`RtlSliceSettings` compiles into the engine as the sole owner of feature
`RtlSlices`, schema 1. Its codec uses Hz and stable keyed IDs, nested squelch,
normalized modes/AGC, and model percentages. Representation bounds are inherited
from `SharedCapturePolicy`; they are not an advertised receiver count or RF range.
Whole-document validation finishes before exposing any parsed state. Explicit
patches read the exact row, retain unrelated members and omitted slices, and
remove only explicitly named IDs. Consumers use exact → family → absent;
corrupt/unsupported exact rows fail closed instead of choosing different state.
An empty row is settled and suppresses fallback/import. Existing generic settings
readers retain their previous fallback behavior; the new exact-read status also
distinguishes missing, corrupt, unavailable and present rows and exposes a raw
schema version even when JSON is corrupt.

There is deliberately no runtime call to this new owner or migration yet.
OperatingState remains the sole active RTL tuning/passband/rate owner. F3a does
not claim completed persistence cutover, multi-RX, new DSP controls or improved
hardware acceptance. Current pending/optimistic tuning behavior is unchanged.

## Subsequent cutover ordering

The accepted-capture adapter must first supply achieved center/rate, measured
usable interval, mode/BFO/guard metadata, capacity and accepted receiver state.
F4/M1 provides this; F3a does not invent those values. Then:

1. Obtain the canonical model scope and quiesce the legacy overlapping writer.
2. Call `migrateLegacy(identity)` once per attempted scope access. Only an absent
   effective RtlSlices document permits an exact matching legacy claim. An
   existing valid/empty exact or family document is settled. Newer/malformed or
   unavailable documents refuse and remain retryable. No legacy index-shaped
   `rtl:<n>` row is imported, even if a real reported serial now has that spelling.
   Numeric serials such as `0` remain eligible. Legacy reads remain inside
   `RadioStateMemory`, which returns the exact typed snapshot.
3. Migration writes the complete new document transactionally, never deletes
   the old row and never writes a separate completion marker. Failure must not
   enable a competing new writer or allow an RF-gain save to erase the source.
4. Complete the current-receiver replacement restore/save adapter before removing
   the legacy Tuning/Passband/SpanRate domains. Retain RF gain and memory-bank
   ownership. Later RF-gain saves use the explicit
   `RadioStateMemory::storeRtlRfGainPreservingLegacy()` helper to retain frozen
   old tuning fields for retry/downgrade. Ordinary non-RTL store semantics stay
   unchanged. This helper changes only the known gain value, preserves unknown
   nested gain/extension members, and refuses malformed or future extension
   versions. There must never be two active writers/restore paths for tuning.
5. Supply one prepared descriptor matching each saved ID/frequency/passband to
   `planRestore()`. The production F2 fixed-capture policy validates complete
   intervals and chooses capacity in ascending stable-ID order. Adapter metadata
   cannot alter saved tuning. The plan never moves hardware or changes storage;
   an empty accepted set means retain valid initial runtime state. Persist only
   successfully accepted state; partial restoration never implicitly deletes
   non-restored entries. Explicit user removals remove their stable IDs.

Stored capture center/rate provide context; they do not authorize a post-connect
recenter to accommodate otherwise rejected slices. FM/FM-N now apply accepted
squelch enabled/level values; legacy modes restore with squelch Off. AGC schema
support still does not establish an implemented AGC control. The desktop owns
per-receiver manual/Auto intent separately; see [M1 runtime](rtl-m1-runtime.md).
Live stereo detection is not part of this document.

The headless catalogue remains observe-only and continues publishing its existing
serial locator field. This PR does not expand that public wire schema. A future
headless connection path must retain the same provenance before persistence.

`rtl_slice_settings_test` uses an isolated SQLite profile, direct owner calls,
the production F2 helper and a transport-free injected backend for real model
preconnect/retry/swap/flush paths. It covers anonymous-to-unseen-identified
OperatingState fallback, exact-row precedence, anonymous and duplicate-serial
sharing, preserved/unclaimed locator rows, and the equivalent RtlSlices owner
reads/writes. The old-document validity gate is exercised even when the proposed
patch would replace the malformed field. It opens no radio, listener or synthetic peer.
Physical USB reordering, GUI and RF behavior remain separate validation work.
