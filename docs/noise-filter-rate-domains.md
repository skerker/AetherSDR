# RX noise-filter rate domains (RFC #5468 A2 prerequisite)

This prerequisite prepares the optional wrappers for AudioEngine's rate-aware
RX input. It does not change AudioEngine wiring, its 24 kHz default, radio
production rates, or the disabled RTL multi-receiver runtime.

`DeepFilterFilter`, `SpecbleachFilter` and `MacNRFilter` take an optional
constructor `sampleRate` (24000 by default). `NvidiaAfxFilter` takes it after
the existing optional pack directory. The only supported domains are 24000 and
48000; other rates leave initialization invalid. `process()` consumes and
returns stereo float32 at that immutable domain, and `sampleRate()` identifies
it. Prepare a new instance when the input rate changes; device rate never
selects the wrapper's processing domain.

| Wrapper | 24 kHz | 48 kHz |
|---|---|---|
| RNNoise (already available) | Existing `Legacy24k` contract | `Native48k` with `PreserveRxStereo`, through `process48kStereo()` |
| SpectralNR (already available) | Existing constructor rate | Pass 48000 to the existing rate-aware constructor |
| DeepFilterNet | Existing 24-to-48-to-24 SRC and model | Native48 model input/output; no intermediate24 stage |
| NVIDIA AFX | Existing 24-to-48-to-24 SRC and model | Native48 model input/output; no intermediate24 stage |
| Specbleach | Existing library rate and 40 ms frame request | Native48000 library rate and the same 40 ms request |
| macOS MNR | Existing 512-point FFT / 256-sample hop | 1024-point FFT / 512-sample hop; same frequency resolution and elapsed estimator history |

Every wrapper denoises stereo as two independent channels, the way RNNoise's
`PreserveRxStereo` does: each side has its own algorithm state (and, on the
24 kHz paths, its own SRC pair), and both advance through the same frame
count per block so the image cannot drift. Nothing is mixed to mono, so a
hard-panned diversity pair keeps one antenna per ear and a pan change is heard
as soon as the audio carrying it arrives.

The cost is one instance per channel: about twice the per-block work for every
method, two DeepFilterNet3 models on the DSP thread for DFNR, and two NVIDIA
AFX denoiser effects, each with its own TensorRT engine, for BNR, which roughly
doubles BNR's VRAM and its enable time. BNR uses two single-stream effects
rather than one effect with `NVAFX_PARAM_NUM_STREAMS = 2`, because the batched
form did not isolate the streams.

Each concurrently processed source must own its wrappers. Alternating main48
and Kiwi24 through one instance is invalid even when the rates happen to match:
algorithm history and queued samples belong to one source. Revoke admission,
discard queued processing/output samples, and replace the source's prepared
state at a rate, session, source, or discontinuity boundary. Construction may
load models and allocate; it belongs outside an active processing callback.

`MacNRFilter::reset()` clears its complete state. DeepFilterNet's reset recreates
both channels' models. NVIDIA's reset clears wrapper FIFOs/SRC and calls
`NvAFX_Reset` on both effects. Specbleach's reset clears each channel's noise
profile while the library may retain overlap history. For a strict new epoch,
recreate the complete NVIDIA/Specbleach object. A2 must apply this lifecycle rule to main,
legacy Kiwi and each managed Kiwi source, preserving effect configuration.

The tests distinguish evidence layers. `nr_rate_domain_test` compiles the real
DeepFilterNet/NVIDIA wrapper translation units and substitutes local C APIs
with an explicit half-gain transfer function (plus DFN3's documented delay).
It verifies rate conversion, full-bandwidth native input, algorithm call counts,
irregular block queues, lifecycle, and concurrent-source isolation; it does not
perform neural inference or load an SDK/GPU. `specbleach_rate_domain_test`
executes the bundled library when enabled. `mac_nr_filter_test` executes vDSP
on macOS. None opens a socket or an audio/radio device. Hardware/model inference,
audible playback and the final AudioEngine route require their own evidence.
