# HL2 stream-free telemetry — Design Note

**Status:** Implemented in-family, and deliberately **not constructed by
anything**. The decode half (`MetisProtocol.cpp::parseDiscoveryReply`), the
cadence rule (`Hl2TelemetryCadence.h`), the poller and the service
(`Hl2TelemetryService`) are all built and tested. This note began as the plan
for the poller and stays because §1 is still the reason the cadence is what it
is; it is no longer a proposal.

**Reachable from: nothing yet, and that is the honest state.** The owner of the
service, the `telemetry target <ip>` bridge verb and the `health` merge are a
SEPARATE change — see "Why the owner is not in this change" below. Until that
lands, `Hl2Backend::setTelemetryService()` has no caller, the service is
constructed nowhere, and no operator or bridge surface shows a stream-free row.
Everything below describes what the poller DOES when something drives it, not
what any panel currently shows.

### Why the owner is not in this change

`docs/HERMES.md` gained a section, **"For coding agents — keep bring-up inside
the family backend"** (jensenpat, `f6f56458`, merged in `1457d06d`). It carries
a pre-PR grep over `src/models/RadioModel.*` and others and the rule
*"Unexplained hits mean the work is not localized. Split it or stop."*, and it
separately forbids adding `family == "hl2"` branches above the seam.

The owner of this service cannot live inside `src/core/backends/hl2/`: the whole
argument of §5 is that `Hl2Backend` exists only after a successful connect, and
the states this instrument serves are the ones where there is no backend. So the
owner is model-lifetime code, which is exactly the section's other clause:
*"When the seam itself is missing a verb … that is a separate, capability-shaped
PR, not a drive-by in the wire patch."*

That PR designs the missing seam. This one stops at the family boundary.

**The operator's Radio Health dialog is a third change**, further out still. It
reads `backendHealthSnapshot()` alone and therefore says "Not connected." in
exactly the states this feature exists for. The dialog is core UX and
`GOVERNANCE.md` wants an approved RFC before a PR changes it.

**Scope:** reading the radio's own state — PA temperature, forward and reverse
power, PTT, ADC clip, TX FIFO, PTT hang time — **without an IQ stream**, and
therefore while another client holds the radio or while our own stream is
broken. Roadmap item #15. Transmit behaviour, register *writes*, and the
RQST/ACK command plane (item #13) are out of scope; §6 says why the last of
those is not a prerequisite.

Every claim below is labelled **R** read from source, **M** measured, **I**
inferred, or **A** assumed/unestablished, following the convention `HERMES.md`
§2 argues for. Gateware citations are `softerhardware/Hermes-Lite2` at
`883a338`, the SHA in this radio's discovery string `20231230_74p2_883a338`;
board variant `hl2b5up_main`.

---

## 1. What is already true, and what is missing

AetherSDR already ingests the full telemetry set **while it holds the stream**.
The EP6 C&C bytes carry a four-slot round-robin that free-runs with no request
from us; `MetisClient` applies it from both frames of every packet and publishes
at 10 Hz; `Hl2Backend::publishTelemetry` turns it into SWR, forward watts, PA
temperature and an ADC-overload edge. That path is done. **R**

What does not exist is any way to read the radio when we are *not* streaming:

| situation | in-band (EP6) | today |
|---|---|---|
| we hold the stream | works | fine |
| another client holds the radio | no stream to read | **nothing** |
| our stream has stalled or dropped | the packets that carry telemetry are the packets that stopped | **nothing** |
| connected to nothing yet | no stream | **nothing** |

The last three are exactly where an operator most wants the radio's own state,
and the third is the one that matters most: **the telemetry rides the very
packets whose absence is the fault being diagnosed.** A transport cannot report
its own silence, which is the same lesson `HERMES.md` §21.2 already paid for
with `LinkStats`.

## 2. The route, and why it costs nothing to ask

The 60-byte discovery reply already carries all of it, at offsets `0x17`–`0x29`.
We have been receiving those bytes at every discovery and discarding them since
the parser was written; `parseDiscoveryReply` now decodes them. **R**

The request is the discovery packet we already send: `EF FE 02` + 57 zeros. The
gateware accepts it on ports **1024 and 1025** with no `run` term anywhere in
the decode path (`dsopenhpsdr1.v:185-207`), and builds the same reply either way
(`usopenhpsdr1.v:261-307`). **R**

### 2.1 Port 1025, and why it is not optional

Which port asked decides only where the reply is *addressed*, and that is the
whole reason this design exists. `network.v:686-698`:

```verilog
if (to_port[0]) begin                    // 1025: always update
  udp_destination_ip_sync   <= udp_destination_ip;
end else if (~run) begin                 // 1024: frozen while streaming
  run_destination_ip <= udp_destination_ip;
```

Port 1024 replies go to `run_destination_*`, which is **frozen while `run` is
asserted**. So a port-1024 poll issued while somebody else is streaming is
answered *to that somebody else*. Port 1025 keeps its own destination and always
answers the asker. **R**

Consequence for this design: **the poller uses 1025.** Port 1024 would work only
in the one case where we are the streaming host — which is precisely the case
where we do not need it, because the in-band path is already running.

### 2.1a The target must be NAMED — broadcast is opt-in, and off

An earlier draft let a null target fall back to broadcasting, on the reasoning
that the app should be able to find the radio the way `Hl2Discovery` does. On
this bench that is wrong in both directions at once, and it was caught two
minutes before a scheduled run:

```
host          192.168.36.55/24    broadcast -> 192.168.36.255
ka9q station  192.168.36.38       SAME SEGMENT as the host
radio (DUT)   192.168.8.2         OFF-NET, via gateway 192.168.36.1
```

A broadcast reaches the segment the **station receiver** is on, and can never
reach the radio, which is behind a gateway. So the fallback could not poll the
host we meant, and could put datagrams near a host that must not be polled.

It also produced a reading that looked right for the wrong reason: an
unanswered-poll count rising steadily, which reads as *"the radio is not
replying"* and was really *"there is no radio on this segment at all"*. The
number was correct; what it was **of** was not what anyone assumed. **A**
→ **M** once the interfaces were read.

So: **`setTarget()` is required, and `setAllowBroadcastFallback()` is off by
default.** With neither, the poller sends nothing. Naming the radio is one line
at the call site and removes a whole class of packet nobody asked for.

The automation bridge's `telemetry target <ip>` verb is how an address is meant
to be supplied without connecting. It is **not in this change** — see the status
block at the top and §5 item 3.

### 2.2 It is a read, and stays one

The poller sends exactly one packet type: `EF FE 02`. It never sends
`metis-start`/`metis-stop` on 1024, never issues a port-1025 *command*
(`EF FE 05`), and never writes a register. That is not a convention — it is the
guard that makes it safe to poll a radio another operator is using. `hl2-diag`'s
`hl2_monitor.py` states the same rule for the same reason.

## 3. When to poll — the part that must not be a timer

Discovery **preempts the IQ path**. In `usopenhpsdr1.v`'s transmit state
machine, `START` tests the discovery branch (`:234`) *before* the EP6 branch
(`:238`), so each poll inserts a 60-byte datagram ahead of a queued IQ packet.
**R** How much that costs in practice is **not measured** here; the reply is
~1/17 the size of an EP6 packet, so the delay is small, but "small" is an
inference and not a budget. **I/A**

Three facts bound the cadence, and only one of them is a measurement of the
thing that matters:

- Port 1025 sustains **~86 Hz with zero losses**, round trip 0.6 ms median /
  9.1 ms worst. **M** (`hl2-lab` FACTS, `reference-tx/docs/telemetry-bandwidth.md`)
- **The radio refreshes these fields at 15.6 Hz while idle**, and at one
  conversion per two EP6 packets (~190 Hz at 48 kHz, 1 RX) while streaming.
  **R** — read from the gateware's own divider chain rather than measured; see
  `hl2-lab/streams/hl2-telemetry/docs/telemetry-refresh-rate.md`. This replaces
  the earlier "~10 Hz or faster, unestablished" bound, which came from timing
  changes in a dithering field. Note the second branch is not a property of the
  radio: while another client streams, the converter is clocked by *their*
  packet rate.
- The in-band path already publishes at 10 Hz (`kTelemetryMinIntervalMs`). **R**

So "how fast *can* we poll" is answered and irrelevant. The question is how fast
is *useful*, and above the refresh rate the answer is: not at all — extra polls
return **the same conversion**, provably, not probably. The states we actually
poll in are the idle ones, so 15.6 Hz is the ceiling that binds: **any cadence
above it is spending IQ slots to re-read a number the radio has not regenerated.**

### The rule

**Poll only when the in-band path is not delivering, and poll slowly.**

| state | cadence | why |
|---|---|---|
| we hold the stream and EP6 is arriving | **do not poll at all** | the in-band path already delivers the same fields, in the same units, at 10 Hz. A poll adds contention for zero new information |
| we hold the stream and EP6 has stopped | **2 Hz** | this is the case item #15 exists for. The instrument must keep reading exactly when the thing it shares a socket with has failed |
| another client holds the radio | **1 Hz while something is reading, never otherwise** | a status display, not a meter. And these packets land in someone else's session, so an unwatched poll here is traffic aimed at an operator who did not ask for it |
| idle / not connected | **1 Hz while something is reading, never otherwise** | polling a radio nobody is looking at is pure cost |

The two display states are demand-gated; neither fault state is. A fault is
diagnosed whether or not a panel is open. (`HeldByOther` was unconditional in
the first draft; wiring it up showed that the state latches on as soon as any
in-use radio answers, so an idle app would have polled a stranger's session
forever with nothing on screen.)

**How `HeldByOther` is entered** — **R**. From the radio, not from the picker.
`Hl2Backend::setTelemetryPollTarget(addr, heldByOther)` was written to take the
flag from `Hl2Discovery`, which parses the in-use byte; that wiring was never
built, the only call site passed `false`, and the state was therefore
unreachable — the situation the `telemetry` verb's whole rationale is about
could not be entered. `Hl2Backend::telemetryLinkState()` now reads the same bit
out of the poller's own replies (`DiscoveryReply::streaming`, discovery status
byte `0x03`), which is fresher than a scan and already arrives on this path.
Only consulted while we are *not* connected: our own session sets that bit too.

**And a destination is part of the cadence** — **R**. The table above answers
for a poller that has somewhere to send. With no target and the broadcast
fallback off (its default), `Hl2TelemetryPoller::currentIntervalMs()` is `0`
and no socket is bound — because `0` is what the `telemetryPollMs` row means by
"not polling", and reporting `1000` while nothing left the socket is the same
collapsed state §4 argues against, committed by the instrument itself.

Two things this rule gets right that a single timer would not. It makes the
poller's *duty* the complement of the in-band path's, so the two never compete
for the same wire at the same time. And it puts the highest cadence in the
failure case rather than the healthy one — which is the opposite of what a
"refresh every N ms" timer does, and the whole point of §1's last row.

**Settled since this was written:** the refresh rate, by reading the divider
chain rather than measuring a dithering field — 15.6 Hz idle, ≥190 Hz
streaming. The cadence above stands, and now for a derived reason rather than a
bounded one: 1 Hz sees roughly one conversion in sixteen, which is all a 1 Hz
display can show, and 15.6 Hz is a hard ceiling on any future "make it more
responsive" change to the idle states.

### 3.1 How the state is *measured* — the half this note originally left out

Everything above derives what to do **given** the state. It said nothing about
how the state is determined, and that gap is where the first hardware defect
lived: the rule was right, the thing feeding it was wrong, and the unit test
could not tell.

The obvious implementation is the wrong one. "Did the EP6 packet counter change
since the last tick?" reads as a direct question about the stream, and it is
not — `m_link.rxPackets` is a **mirror**, refreshed from the I/O thread by
`linkCountersUpdated` at 1 Hz, and the tick that read it also ran at 1 Hz. Two
clocks sampling each other. Whenever two ticks fell between two publishes, the
second saw an unchanged counter and reported `StreamStalled` on a perfectly
healthy stream, and since `StreamStalled` is one of the two states that poll
**without** a visible surface, the app emitted port-1025 datagrams through its
own live session — the precise thing §3's first row forbids. **M**
(2026-09-04: `telemetryPollMs` oscillating 0 → 500 → 0 while the in-band
temperature changed on every sample and `telemetryAgeMs` reset, i.e. replies
were landing.)

**This is a certainty, not a race that might not happen.** The publish is gated
by `elapsed() < kLinkPublishIntervalMs` and checked on packet arrival, so its
period is bounded *below* by 1000 ms and in practice runs a little over. The
tick is a steady 1000 ms. A sequence never faster than the tick and sometimes
slower must fall behind without bound, so a tick with no intervening publish is
inevitable; only its arrival time is in doubt. **R**

That also settles what the Config C capture proved. It ran 60 s and saw
nothing, which was read as proof of silence. Drift between two nominally-equal
clocks beats slowly and phase-dependently, so a 60 s window can sit in a quiet
phase while a 24 s window hours later hits it repeatedly. Config C establishes
*"no port-1025 traffic seen in one 60 s window"* — a bound, not the claim.

**The rule.** Measure elapsed time since the counter last advanced, not a
tick-to-tick delta:

| input | what it actually measures |
|---|---|
| counter changed since the last tick | the **tick** as much as the stream |
| ms since the counter last advanced | the stream only, at any tick rate |

`kStreamStallDeclareMs = 2500` — two publish intervals plus margin. A healthy
stream never reaches it because the publish period is bounded below by 1000 ms;
two consecutive missed publishes do. The clock is restarted **in the mirror**,
on an actual advance, because `linkCountersUpdated` fires whether or not EP6
moved: "a publish arrived" is not "packets arrived".

**"But the I/O side already knows this."** It does, and the answer is worth
writing down because it is the first question a reader should ask.
`MetisClient::m_sinceLastEp6` is restarted on every EP6 packet and is exactly the
quantity wanted — with none of the 1 Hz quantisation, since it is updated at the
packet rate. It is unusable from here: `m_metis` is `moveToThread(m_ioThread)`,
so reading that member from the backend's thread is a data race, and the whole
reason `m_link` exists is to be the seam where I/O-thread state is republished on
the reader's thread. **R**

So the mirror is not an accident to be routed around; it is the thread boundary,
and its 1 Hz cadence is a property of that boundary rather than an oversight.
What was wrong was reading a 1 Hz seam with a 1 Hz sampler and treating the
result as an observation of the stream. A finer-grained answer would mean
publishing a timestamp across the seam, not reaching across it.

One consequence worth stating for whoever changes this next: **the mirror
publishes whether or not EP6 advanced.** `publishLinkCountersIfDue()` is called
at the end of `onReadyRead()`, while `++m_link.rxPackets` happens only after the
EP6 filter — a wakeup carrying nothing but a stray discovery reply therefore
publishes counters with the packet count unchanged. **R** That is why the stall
clock is restarted on an actual counter ADVANCE and not merely on the arrival of
a publish: "a publish arrived" and "packets arrived" are two different facts, and
the seam carries both.

**The cost, stated rather than buried:** a real stall is declared 2.5–3.5 s
after it starts instead of ~1 s. The old ~1 s was not real. It was a coin flip
that paid for its apparent speed with false stalls on healthy streams.

The two states this collapsed, in the vocabulary of `collapsed-states.md`: *"the
stream stopped"* and *"our sampling missed it"* rendered identically, and the
second is far more common. The fix does not make the reading perfect — it makes
the two distinguishable, because only one of them can survive 2.5 s.

## 4. Which source wins, and the state that must not collapse

Two paths now produce the same fields in the same raw units — deliberately, so
they cross-check rather than being two unrelated numbers. When both have spoken,
**the in-band reading wins**: it is fresher, it costs nothing extra, and it is
the one whose cadence we control.

But a consumer must be able to tell these apart, and they are three states, not
two:

| reading shown as | actually |
|---|---|
| absent | **we have never asked** · **we asked and got no reply** · we asked, got a reply, and the field was not in it |

Those want different actions — start the poller, check the network, accept that
this gateware has no `EXTENDED_RESP` — so the model carries the *source and the
age* alongside the value, not a bare optional. The pattern is `HERMES.md`
§21.3's: a measurement of nothing and the absence of a measurement are different
claims, and a readout that renders both as a dash has picked one.

The specific traps already known:

- **`adcClipCount` means two different things depending on `streaming`.**
  Only an EP6 packet clears it (`control.v:465`), so while streaming it is
  "clip windows in the last EP6 interval, 0–3 saturating" and while idle it is
  "clipped at least once since the last stream ended" — stuck at 3, and a
  poller cannot clear it. It is not a count either: `rxclip` is a sticky rail
  latch added as a *level*, so a few clock edges saturate it. **R** Any surface
  showing it must pair it with the streaming state, and **must never derive a
  rate**. The window is now readable — `rxclrstatus` toggles every `clk_ctrl`
  cycle and crosses via `sync_pulse`, so `rxclip` is cleared every **400 ns**
  (**R**) — but `rxclip` returns through a plain `sync`, a level, into a 2.5 MHz
  domain, so a 400 ns assertion is sampled by a 400 ns clock and **hits can be
  missed at the crossing** (**A**, marginal timing the source cannot settle).
  That is a third reason against a rate, not a weaker one.
- **`0x03` in the status byte is `run` OR a gateware flash erase having just
  finished** (`usopenhpsdr1.v:266`), and `0x04` is a flash write in progress.
  **R** Harmless while nobody flashes over Ethernet; named so it is not
  rediscovered.
- **A gateware without `EXTENDED_RESP` sends hard zeros in these bytes**
  (`control.v:826, :914`), which this layer cannot distinguish from genuine
  zeros. Our board sets `EXTENDED_RESP(1)`
  (`variants/hl2b5up_main/hermeslite.v:110`). **R** A caller needing certainty
  must compare across polls; the decode says so at the site rather than
  pretending.

## 5. Shape of the change

Additive, and outside the region `Hl2Backend`'s transmit drive path occupies.

1. **Done.** `parseDiscoveryReply` decodes `0x17`–`0x29` into optional fields on
   `DiscoveryReply`, with the gateware's offsets pinned by test against
   `usopenhpsdr1.v`'s own down-counter.
2. **Done.** `Hl2TelemetryPoller`, one UDP socket to `<radio>:1025`, sending
   `EF FE 02` on the §3 schedule, owned by `Hl2TelemetryService`.
   `Hl2Backend::setTelemetryService()` takes a BORROWED pointer and drives the
   link state while a backend exists; it does not own the service and cannot,
   because it only exists after a successful connect and the no-connection case
   is the point. **In this change that setter has no caller.**
3. **Next, and not here.** The owner: something with model lifetime that
   constructs the service, a bridge verb that aims it without connecting —
   `connectRadio()` is the only other way to supply an address and it sends
   Metis START, a write during another operator's session — and the merge that
   puts its rows into `health`. That is seam design, not wire work, and it is
   its own PR.
4. **Then.** The surface that renders source and age, including the "another
   client holds the radio" case which no existing readout has ever had to
   express.

## 6. Why item #13 is not a prerequisite

The roadmap calls RQST/ACK (item #13) "the gate for everything below it" and
also calls item #15 "pollable without a stream, the cheapest first increment".
Settled in the lab's `streams/hl2-telemetry/docs/gating.md`: they are about
different channels, and the contradiction is in the word "below" in a table, not
in the radio.

RQST/ACK is the **command-echo** path — `iresp <= {1'b1, resp_cmd_addr, ...}`
with the gateware's own `// Queue size is 1` (`control.v:467-468`) — and it
gates the *register* plane: PA bias, config EEPROM, AD9866 registers, the IO
board. **R** None of temperature, power, PTT or clip is a command response.
They ride the discovery reply unconditionally, and the EP6 slots automatically.
Nothing in this design sends `EF FE 05`, and nothing in it needs to.

## 7. What this note does not establish

- **Nothing here is measured** except the two figures explicitly marked **M**,
  both from `reference-tx`'s bandwidth run rather than from this code.
- ~~The radio's telemetry **refresh rate**~~ — **settled by reading**, not by a
  run: 15.6 Hz idle, ≥190 Hz streaming. See
  `hl2-lab/streams/hl2-telemetry/docs/telemetry-refresh-rate.md`. Config B no
  longer needs to measure it, and the cadence is now derived rather than argued.
- The **wire cost of a poll during streaming** (§3) — bounded by inference from
  packet sizes, not measured.
- The **`rxclip` window** in wall-clock terms (§4), without which no clip rate
  exists.
- Whether a port-1024 poll from the *streaming* host is answered to itself. The
  gateware says the reply goes to `run_destination_*`, which is that host — but
  it has not been run, and this design does not depend on it, because it uses
  1025.
