# TCI Receiver Index Policy

_Changed in [e49875b2](https://github.com/aethersdr/AetherSDR/commit/e49875b2) (#2140)._

## Overview

AetherSDR exposes Flex 6000-series slices to TCI clients (WSJT-X, JTDX,
etc.) as numbered **receivers** (`trx` indexes in the TCI protocol).
Since #2140 these indexes follow a contiguous numbering scheme rather
than passing through raw Flex slice IDs.

The receiver-index policy is only one half of the routing contract. Channel
0/1, split, TX ownership, and acknowledgement ordering are defined in
[TCI Routing and Ordering Contract](tci-routing-ordering.md).

## Rules

1. **Dense initial `0..N-1` indexing.**
   Each newly seen slice is assigned the lowest free receiver index. If you
   initially own slices with Flex IDs 1 and 3, TCI advertises `trx_count:2`
   and maps them to receivers 0 and 1. Raw Flex IDs never appear on the wire.

2. **Live indexes are stable.**
   A receiver binding is pinned to its Flex slice ID. A band-stack
   destroy/recreate holds that binding through the settle window, so the
   recreated slice returns on the same receiver and surviving slices do not
   silently move. A genuinely closed slice frees its receiver after the
   settle window; a later slice fills the lowest hole. `trx_count` remains one
   plus the highest held/live receiver, so a temporary hole never invalidates
   a receiver a client is already using. Clients should still rediscover the
   mapping on a new radio session.

3. **Legacy-client fallback.**
   `TciProtocol::sliceForTrx()` includes a compatibility path: if the
   requested TRX index is out of the `0..N-1` range, it searches for a
   slice whose raw Flex `sliceId()` matches.  If that also fails it falls
   back to the first owned slice.  This keeps older clients that cached
   raw Flex IDs functional in the common single-slice case.

   **The first-slice fallback does not apply to paths that key the radio.**
   `resolveSliceForTrxStrict()` performs the same positional and raw-id
   resolution but returns `nullptr` instead of guessing, and
   `TciServer::handleTrxRequest()` uses it: an unresolvable receiver is
   declined with `trx:<n>,false;` rather than transmitting on a slice the
   client never addressed, on that slice's band and antenna (#4547).  A
   guess is a reasonable answer for a read and an unacceptable one under
   PTT.

4. **A client's declared audio receiver identifies it.**
   Every WSJT-X instance in TCI/ESDR3 mode addresses `trx:0`, so with two
   instances on two slices the wire request carries nothing that tells
   them apart.  `TciServer::effectiveTrx()` resolves a client's PTT
   against the receiver it declared in `audio_start:<n>`, falling back to
   the wire index when it declared none (control-only clients such as the
   Stream Deck plugin).  Replies still echo the trx the client sent — the
   binding changes which slice is addressed, never the wire shape.

   **Only `trx:0` is redirected.**  The declared receiver is evidence of
   intent, not an address that outranks one — and it is good evidence
   exactly where the wire carries none: `trx:0` is the ambiguous default
   every WSJT-X instance sends whatever receiver it operates.  A non-zero
   trx is a deliberate address and is honoured as sent.  A client that
   declared audio on receiver 0 and then asks for `trx:1` means receiver 1;
   overriding it there would key a slice the client never asked for, on
   that slice's band and antenna — which is #4547's own defect class, and
   the fix must not re-enter it.

   This follows Thetis, which scopes RX-audio enabled-receiver sets per
   client while radio state stays global (see the oracle's shared-versus-
   per-client table).  That split is also why the declaration informs the
   ambiguous case rather than overriding an explicit one: it is per-client
   audio evidence being read, not per-client radio state being asserted.

5. **Two channels per receiver.**
   AetherSDR advertises `channels_count:2`. Channel 0 is the receiver's RX
   slice. Channel 1 is the resolved radio-global TX slice for that RX route —
   unless that slice is another client's currently declared receiver and no
   split is requested, in which case channel 1 is echoed, not routed (#5193;
   a slice with no live declaration routes as before). The same rule holds
   on PTT: a route bound onto that slice before the other client declared
   it does not survive the declaration, so a bare `trx` keys the requesting
   receiver's own slice, never the other client's.
   The route uses stable Flex slice IDs internally even if public TRX indexes
   shift after topology changes.

6. **Eight commands carry no receiver index at all.**
   `cw_macros_speed`, `cw_keyer_speed`, `cw_macros_delay`, `mon_volume`,
   `mon_enable`, `cw_terminal`, `digl_offset` and `digu_offset` are global —
   the value is the *first* argument, not the second. So is `volume`, and
   `mic_level` / `tx_gain` are the AetherSDR extensions with the same shape.

   This matters because the dispatcher derives GET-versus-SET from the
   argument count (`isSet = args.size() >= 2`), which is the *trx-prefixed*
   shape every per-slice verb uses. On a global verb that derivation is wrong
   in both directions, and all eight carried the bug until #4867: the spec
   form `mon_volume:50;` was read as a GET and the value silently discarded,
   while `mon_volume:0,50;` was taken as a SET whose value was read from the
   trx slot, setting the monitor gain to `0`. Both broadcast a well-formed
   notification, so neither the sender nor a second client could tell.

   These handlers therefore re-derive GET/SET from the argument list
   themselves — **empty args = GET, otherwise SET reading the last
   argument** — and both wire forms are accepted, the spec one and the legacy
   trx-prefixed one.

   **`mon_volume:0;` is a SET of 0, not a read.** A client written against
   the trx-prefixed shape of the neighbouring verbs may send it meaning "read
   receiver 0's monitor gain"; it will instead zero the monitor and the
   operator will hear it. This is deliberate: silently refusing a legitimate
   `0` — an ordinary thing for an operator to ask for — would be the same
   undetectable-from-the-wire failure pointed the other way, and the client
   can always read the value back. Send the bare `mon_volume;` to read.

7. **Booleans are spelled `true` and `false`, and nothing else is accepted.**
   Unparseable boolean arguments are dropped, exactly as unparseable numeric
   ones are: `mute:0,yes;` used to become `false` and *unmute* the slice.

   The two exceptions are `tune` and `keyer`, which key the transmitter.
   There, anything that is not the word `true` still means **stop / key up**,
   because dropping an unparseable stop would leave a keyed transmitter keyed.
   Those two fail closed rather than fail silent (Constitution VI).

8. **`cw_macros` numeric receiver indexes fail closed.**
   The spec form is `cw_macros:<trx>,<text>;`. A base-10 integer first
   argument is always interpreted as a receiver address: an index in the
   currently advertised `0..N-1` range is stripped before the text reaches
   the radio, while an out-of-range, negative, or stale index drops the
   command. It is never reinterpreted as CW text, because that would put the
   address on the air (#4997).

   A nonnumeric first argument is retained as text for compatibility with
   clients that omit the index. This is deliberately asymmetric: an
   index-less macro beginning with a decimal number is ambiguous on the wire,
   so transmit safety and the documented receiver-prefixed form win. The
   parser fails closed rather than risk either keying the address or silently
   removing a legitimate numeric payload (Constitution VI/VII).

## IQ Stream Subscriptions

TCI IQ subscriptions are scoped by both client and receiver. One WebSocket may
send `iq_start:0;` through `iq_start:3;` to run several band skimmers
concurrently. `iq_stop:<n>;` affects only that receiver for that client; the
client's other band streams continue uninterrupted. Type-0 binary frames carry
the subscribed receiver index in their header.

**A receiver's IQ comes from the DAX IQ channel bound to that receiver's *pan*,
not from `trx + 1` directly.** On a FLEX, `daxiq_channel` is a Panadapter
property, and the pan↔channel binding is 1:1 in **both** directions — measured
on a FLEX-6700 running V1.4.0.0: binding a channel to a second panadapter makes
the radio push `daxiq_channel=0` to the first, unasked. Two consequences follow,
and they are the whole shape of this design:

1. **Receivers whose slices share a panadapter share one DAX IQ channel.**
   The ordinary A/B layout puts two slices on one pan. Binding a second channel
   there would silently steal the first one back, leaving a subscription that
   was acknowledged, still holds one of the four DAX IQ slots, and carries
   nothing — with no log line and nothing in `tci status` to tell it from a
   working one. Since both receivers see the *same* spectrum, one stream
   legitimately serves both: the payload is fanned out once per subscribed
   receiver, each frame stamped with that receiver's own index. Four skimmers
   therefore need four panadapters, not four slices, and a shared pan costs one
   DAX IQ slot rather than two.

2. **A channel the DAX IQ applet already owns is refused, never borrowed.**
   TCI only ever drives channels it created. Taking over an existing stream
   would move the operator's pan off it (per the 1:1 rule above, stopping their
   IQ consumer at the source) and force TCI's sample rate onto it, and nothing
   restores either. `iq_start` for such a receiver is refused instead.

The receiver a channel is allocated *for* still follows #3913's mapping — TCI
receiver `n` takes DAX IQ channel `n + 1` when its pan does not already have one:

| TCI receiver | DAX IQ channel |
|---:|---:|
| 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 4 |

**A refused `iq_start` answers.** #3913 established that a skimmer blocks on the
confirmation, so silence hangs it. Every refusal — unmapped receiver, borrowed
channel, foreign-owned pan, a backend with no DAX — replies `iq_stop:<n>;`, the
truthful state echo, and the receiver is *not* subscribed. Equally, `iq_start:`
is only answered once the stream is actually armed: acknowledging a start whose
create or pan bind was refused tells a client it has a receiver it can never
use, and a client cannot retry what it was told worked. The `display pan set`
ownership gate (#3977) is checked before anything is claimed, so a pan another
client owns refuses the start rather than leaving an inert stream behind.

The radio-side stream is shared and reference-counted. AetherSDR keeps a channel
while any TCI client remains subscribed to any receiver bound to it, and on the
last stop or disconnect removes the stream **and releases the pan binding**
(`daxiq_channel=0`) — leaving it set would end a session with a panadapter
routed at a channel nothing reads, which then blocks the applet from using that
pan. A stop that beats the radio's stream-create status parks until the status
arrives, because `DaxIqModel` cannot remove an id it has not learned yet.

Ownership, an unconfirmed create, and a pending removal are tracked as three
separate facts. Conflating them wedges a receiver: a create that is lost or
rejected can never be re-issued, and the claim survives the `stop()`/`start()`
cycle that the TCI applet's enable toggle and port change both perform on the
same server object, so no later client can get IQ either.

`iq_samplerate` is the shared rate for all TCI IQ receivers. A valid SET is
applied to every channel TCI owns and remembered for channels created later, and
is announced to peers as well as the requester (#3913). A GET, and a rejected
SET, report the rate in force on a live stream rather than the last value TCI
was asked for. The default is 48000, and TCI asserts it on the channels it
creates — it does not discover a rate from the radio. A client connecting after
another has moved the rate is told the rate in force in its init burst, not the
default.

Logical subscriptions survive a radio reconnect and the stable-receiver slice
recreation window, and are re-armed against the same receiver/pan binding when
the slice returns. The pan binding is required because the DAX IQ channel is
centered on the pan reported by `dds`, not merely on its slice frequency.

## Spot Click Notifications

When a visible spot is clicked, AetherSDR broadcasts the click to every
connected TCI client using both protocol spellings:

- `clicked_on_spot:<callsign>,<frequency_hz>;`
- `rx_clicked_on_spot:<receiver>,0,<callsign>,<frequency_hz>;`

The receiver is the same contiguous `trx` index used by `vfo:` and
`modulation:` events.  The channel field is `0`, matching AetherSDR's
single-VFO path for a slice.  This mirrors Thetis behavior and keeps older
clients such as Log4OM working while giving TCI v2 clients receiver context.

Both spellings are emitted **unconditionally** for every spot click — there
is no client-capability handshake.  This is the v2 protocol baseline
introduced by #3145; third-party log clients writing TCI protocol parsers
should expect to see both messages back-to-back for every click, not just
the legacy `clicked_on_spot:` form.

## Why this changed

Flex slice IDs are radio-global and not necessarily contiguous within a
single client's owned set.  TCI's `trx_count` / receiver model assumes
`0..N-1` numbering.  Passing raw IDs caused WSJT-X to address
non-existent receivers when another client owned slice 0, breaking
multi-slice TCI operation (TCI1/TCI2).
