# Bounded receive-contract test foundation

Issue #5890 seeds the first test slice of #5554 section 2.3. Issue #5904 extends
it through the first #5262 M4 receive-command conversion. This is not full backend
conformance certification and does not replace hardware convergence testing.

`tests/backend_receive_contract_test.cpp` keeps one test-only family registry
and one request group: frequency, mode, filter, and AGC mode/threshold. There
is no new production dispatch registry or protocol method. Each family prints
its coverage level, including an explicit `NOT BUILT` row for optional RTL.

| Family | Concrete implementation exercised | What this does not establish |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flex | Exact guarded slice-sink commands, pan intent, filter origin, individual AGC fields; separately decoded status; no command echo from decode | Firmware acceptance, pan creation through the compatibility adapter |
| Icom | Real CI-V scheduler with an unstarted transport; separately injected frequency/mode/filter/AGC reports and stale-generation rejection | Actual RS-BA1 delivery or firmware behavior |
| HL2 | Pre-connect receiver configuration plus a socket-free real RX worker: mode/filter ordering, CW passband translation and applied AGC pair | Live Metis delivery, RF convergence or completed tuning/shift application |
| ANAN | Pre-connect receiver configuration and retained WDSP AGC values, owner-thread signals | Live Protocol 2 delivery or completed DSP application |
| Demo | Production synthetic session state and refusal before/after the session | Hardware behavior; filter/AGC DSP that Demo does not implement |
| RTL (optional) | Declaration and cold receive refusal, without opening USB | Connected USB/DDC dispatch |

Icom command checks inspect the first outbound entry in the production CI-V
trace, including its address and framing, rather than requiring an immediate
single dispatch. Confirmation reads and filter PBT writes may follow it. An
explicit scheduler-time advance exercises reply expiry and verifies that a
later dispatch cannot replace the first-command evidence; no sleeps or new
production test hooks are used. The two Icom-facing tests share one existing
friend-helper definition in `IcomReceiveContractTestAccess.h`.

The headless capability records are checked separately from desktop verbs.
Icom and ANAN mode/filter remain unadvertised to daemon clients; that does not
mean the desktop implementations are absent. Demo's stored filter state does
not justify advertising a functional daemon filter operation. No AGC protocol
method is added here.

`tests/icom_panadapter_capacity_test.cpp` covers every known Icom profile and
the unknown/no-scope fallback. It follows production backend setup and the
capability notification through `RadioModel` into `RadioResourceAdapter`.
The implemented scope owns one pan identity, so scope-capable dual-receiver
models advertise one panadapter, not two (#5347). Slice capacity is unchanged.
The desktop `maxPanadapters()` getter is checked for every scope-capable
profile. Its existing zero/unknown fallback is not redesigned here, nor is
the unsupported-versus-exhausted `panadapterLimitReached` signal distinction.
Optional filter-preset verbs are outside this first receive group.

Existing `control_receive_test` and `control_slice_frequency_test` retain the
direct daemon target/service tests. `backend_slice_lifecycle_test`,
`backend_family_switch_test`, and `backend_capability_revision_test` retain
the model lifecycle, compatibility-adapter, generation and revision checks.
An inherited lifecycle method returning false is not proof that Flex's or
hybrid Demo's model-owned compatibility path is broken.

`receive_intent_routing_test` drives both production model construction paths,
including repeat wiring, synchronous observations, reconnect/reused object IDs,
reentrant setters, off-thread refusal and frequency notification/provenance
ordering. The daemon tests pin explicit preserve-pan and operator-filter
requests while retaining admission checks and observation-only state. Actual
GUI linked-slice behavior still needs bridge proof; notification ordering alone
is not a substitute for the GUI's link adapter. The HL2 worker fixture uses the
existing friend access to open only its RX DSP and reads the applied channel on
the worker thread. It never starts Metis, connects hardware or configures TX.
ANAN remains configuration-state coverage, not a claim of DSP completion.

These tests are unconditional default CTests, registered in
`tests/tests.cmake`; they run in the main full-suite and sanitizer lanes.
The frozen per-PR CI allowlist is unchanged. None opens a network session,
synthesizes third-party firmware or invokes keying.

## Consolidated slice receive controls (#5917)

The next M4 group uses typed DSP, audio and squelch requests plus slice-aware
antenna and lock intents. `RadioModel` binds them once on both slice creation
paths, checks the exact active object and owner thread, and rejects staged,
disconnected or retired senders. Desktop notifications precede dispatch so a
synchronous backend correction remains the final visible value. Nested edits
retain the newest value, including the paired DSP state and squelch field mask.

| Backend | Existing desktop behavior retained | Explicitly not added |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flex | Independent DSP enable/level fields, AF gain/mute/balance, separate squelch writes, RX port and per-slice lock through the guarded sink | Slice manual notch (TNF is separate), new daemon audio capability |
| Icom | Paired NB/NR, ANF enable, manual-notch position, AF gain, squelch threshold, profile-supported RX port and global dial lock | AF mute/balance, Flex extended DSP |
| HL2 | Existing RX-worker NB, CW APF, mode-aware squelch and receiver mixer gain/mute/balance | Radio-side NR/ANF/manual notch |
| RTL (optional) | Confirmed gain/mute/balance and FM/FM-N squelch for sparse configured receiver IDs | DSP or radio antenna controls; injected-USB model tests are offline |
| Demo | NB and ANF affect the existing production signal generator | Independent AF mixer or new advertised DSP capabilities |
| ANAN | Existing WDSP NB, slice mixer gain/mute/balance and client-only tune lock | Additional DSP or transport |

`ReceiveDispatch` distinguishes a dispatched operation, a client-only lock, and
an unsupported operation. It is not hardware acknowledgement. Unsupported
requests feed the existing one-shot unsupported-control notice and log. Icom's
mute/balance and Demo AF gain/mute/balance, squelch and NB level are explicitly
refused; optimistic presentation alone is not evidence of backend dispatch.
Changing these refusals to client-local success requires a maintainer decision
and proof of the local effect; this migration does not invent that effect.
Icom's global lock is distinct from Flex's slice lock; a family with neither retains
the local tune lock. No `RadioCapabilities` fields or serialized feature records
change. In particular, Flex and Icom desktop AF support does not authorize the
daemon's guarded receive-audio methods.

Kiwi replacement volume/balance/mute and squelch remain local. Its primary-Flex
suppression mute, band-recall release and reassertion use an explicit compatibility
origin. NRS firmware-default profile recall likewise carries a restore origin;
normal observations remain passive. Existing Kiwi/squelch/APF/antenna tests now
observe the typed dispatch surface, not retired raw-command signals.
HL2, ANAN and RTL refuse the primary-native suppression origin: they did not
mute native audio for Kiwi before this migration either. Typed compatibility
requests do not add that missing handoff; only the existing Flex path is retained.

The extended backend contract test checks all Flex field encodings and separate
readback, Icom scheduler output, actual HL2 worker NB/APF/squelch configuration
and mixer configuration, and Demo's worker blanker state and ANF effect on generated
samples. The Demo worker is read through a test-only friend on its own thread;
this is not a fake firmware peer. New model tests cover both construction paths,
unique wiring, stale IDs, reconnect, off-thread refusal, nested edits, deletion,
explicit unsupported results and NRS restore. These remain in the existing
unconditional CTest targets; the frozen PR gate is unchanged.

The landed `anan_noise_blanker_readback_test` additionally pins model dispatch
across same/different-radio reconnect and typed NB requests through the actual
ANAN worker, keeping requested and applied state separate during a DSP rebuild.
The adapter delegates to #5824's existing NB implementation; it adds no DSP,
transport, thread or capability.

The landed split-audio preference recorder consumes typed operator audio intents,
not radio readback or external-receive suppression. Its production translation
helpers are shared by the socket-free `split_audio_profile_test`, which covers
repeated apply/arm/restore cycles, non-operator writes, suppression/reassertion,
and keeping everyday RX gain/mute outside split learning.

TX controls, RIT/XIT, FM repeater and digital offsets, diversity, panadapter
commands and DAX/PCM transport are outside this batch. The separate audio-path
migration is not duplicated here.
