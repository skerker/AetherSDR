# TX control testing — standard authorization and method

Use this prompt and method for live automation-bridge tests against a real
radio. Replace every bracketed value; do not infer them from an earlier run.

## Authorization prompt

> Run a control-and-transmit sweep against `[RADIO MODEL]` over the AetherSDR
> automation bridge. The dummy load is connected to `[EXACT TX ANTENNA VALUE]`.
> You are authorized to transmit up to `[MAX PHYSICAL WATTS] W` at
> `[FREQUENCY]` in `[MODE]`.
>
> Before keying, assert the exact live TX antenna, tuner bypass, frequency,
> mode, RF Power, and Tune Power. Treat an unreadable state as failure. Apply a
> conservative percentage ceiling and a separate measured-watt watchdog; a
> power-control percentage is not watts. Unkey immediately on over-limit power,
> missing/stale power telemetry, high SWR, timeout, disconnect, or any state
> disagreement.
>
> Cover meters, control set/reply/external-change paths, a short TX window, and
> a complete AetherSDR restart. Verify actual visible widgets, not only models.
> Restore all non-transmitting state, confirm the radio is unkeyed, and leave
> the tuner bypassed if restoring its prior state would require RF.

## Hard safety gates

All gates must pass before each keying stage:

1. Explicit authorization names the radio, frequency/mode, exact dummy-load
   antenna value, and maximum physical watts.
2. `dumpTree` reports exactly that TX antenna. Empty, ambiguous, or different
   values abort the run.
3. The tuner already reports bypass. `atu bypass` does not key, but changing a
   tuned state is not automatically reversible without a new RF tune cycle.
4. RF Power and Tune Power are both read and staged conservatively. Icom
   two-tone uses Tune Power; an ATU cycle may use backend/radio-specific drive.
5. `AETHER_AUTOMATION_TX_MAX_POWER` is treated only as a 0–100 control
   percentage ceiling. It is never reported as a watt limit.
6. A calibrated forward-power meter must produce a fresh sample promptly after
   key. Unkey on the first sample above the authorized watt limit. This is a
   reactive backstop and cannot prevent the first transient; use an external
   wattmeter/interlock when a transient would be unacceptable.
7. Every exit path sends unkey and confirms tuning, MOX, model transmitting,
   and radio transmitting are false.

Do not run unattended TX certification on a backend with no calibrated live
power meter unless an independent physical interlock enforces the watt limit.

## Evidence sequence

### 1. Baseline and liveness

- Confirm one automation instance and no competing radio session.
- Capture `whoami`, `liveness`, `health`, `controls map`, `controls meters`, and
  the relevant `dumpTree` widgets.
- At idle, require the visible forward-power gauge to read zero. A retained
  backend sample is diagnostic history, not current power.

### 2. Control convergence

For each control:

1. record the operator's original radio and UI value;
2. drive the actual widget or semantic bridge verb;
3. verify expected protocol bytes from the model's official guide;
4. wait for the radio reply and verify model plus actual widget;
5. change it externally at the radio or with a safe raw protocol command;
6. allow two periodic-poll intervals and verify model plus widget again; and
7. restore the original value when restoration does not transmit.

For Icom 0000–0255 percentage levels, independently calculate:

```
write raw = ceil(percent * 255 / 100)
read percent = floor(raw * 100 / 255)
```

Do not use that formula for `15 xx` meters; use the model-specific published
calibration curve. CI-V Transceive is helpful but is not accepted as the only
subscription path.

### 3. Short transmit window

- Begin with the lowest authorized Tune Power percentage.
- Sample forward power, SWR, ALC, compression, voltage, current, and thermal
  data that the radio actually supports. Mark unsupported meters as such.
- Reject stale ages and rail-pinned values. Do not substitute scalar defaults
  for unsupported temperature or voltage. Report ALC in its declared native unit.
- The forward-power median now aggregates only samples that also carry a finite
  `fwdPowerInstant` within the 500 ms safety window, rather than any smoothed
  reading under 1500 ms. A backend that publishes `fwdPower` but no instant peak
  reports no median at all — that is a reporting-surface gap, not a radio fault.
- Start the freshness deadline at the key command, including command latency.
  A sample predating that command cannot qualify as this burst's telemetry.
  That rule governs what may be RECORDED, not what may stop the run: an SWR or
  forward-power reading over its ceiling still aborts on the ordinary 1500 ms
  reporting window, because an alarming sample is a reason to unkey whether or
  not it postdates the key command.
- In CW, a zero-carrier gap deliberately nulls the displayed SWR. It can continue
  only after a qualified SWR was observed in this burst, with fresh zero-watt
  power and fresh SWR receive timestamps. Missing/stale telemetry and a missing
  ratio with positive power still stop the run. The 0.9 s deadline, the 500 ms
  safety-freshness window and the watt ceiling are unchanged; the post-key rule
  narrows only which samples may enter an aggregate.
- Icom's and the HL2's current TUNE producers are a single sine wave. `txtest
  twotone` refuses any backend that does not declare a `twoToneGenerator`; do
  not record ordinary TUNE output as two-tone or IMD proof.
- Verify the actual power gauge is live only while keyed.
- Unkey immediately, then verify the gauge is zero both at the edge and after a
  late in-flight response could arrive.

Use the guarded harness:

```bash
python3 tools/tx_meter_test.py \
  --serial RADIO_SERIAL --ant ANT1 --frequency 14.2 --mode USB \
  --max-watts 10 \
  --levels 2,5
```

`--levels` and `--two-tone-percent` are Tune Power control settings, not measured
watts. `--max-control` bounds both RF and Tune controls (default 5). Each burst
rechecks the exact radio, TX slice, antenna, frequency, mode, offsets, VOX and
bypass state. The sampling window repeats the context check and uses fresh
**unsmoothed** `fwdPowerInstant` for the watt cutoff; it records peak watts,
peak SWR and every sampled meter row. Missing/unknown link state, a missing or
stale calibrated power definition, and missing/stale SWR stop the run. Unkey
is confirmed before restoring power; unknown TX flags never count as unkeyed.
Where the backend answers `civ scheduler freshness` with a `stateFreshness`
block, model flags alone are insufficient: the harness additionally requires
`stateFreshness.fields.ptt` to report a confirmed false value received during
that unkey observation window and younger than 500 ms, carrying
`accepted: true` and `pending: false`. `accepted` is what separates a real
readback from a stale frame that merely agreed with the pending unkey intent;
the backend publishes both, and only the first is proof. An app build that does
not report the field fails closed. The gate is keyed on the
backend answering, not on a radio name. A backend without CI-V diagnostics — or
an older app build — takes the flags-only path.

### 4. Restart proof

Close AetherSDR completely and repeat the baseline with a fresh process. Verify
distinctive safe values are adopted from the radio rather than replayed from
client defaults. Repeat one external-change/poll test. A same-process
disconnect/reconnect is useful but does not replace an application restart.

## Deliverable

Report a table with one row per control/meter and separate columns for:

- set path;
- protocol value;
- same-session radio reply;
- visible widget;
- external-change convergence;
- post-restart adoption; and
- restoration.

Report peak measured watts, SWR, telemetry freshness, abort reason, and final
unkey state. Never call a percentage setting “watts.”
