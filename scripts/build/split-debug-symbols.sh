#
# Linux: each binary must carry a GNU build ID, which is what gdb, eu-addr2line,
# coredumpctl and debuginfod key on. Its DWARF moves to
# OUT_DIR/.build-id/<xx>/<rest>.debug (gdb's own layout, so pointing
# debug-file-directory at OUT_DIR is enough) and is removed from the binary.
# The build ID survives the later install, patchelf and linuxdeploy strip.
#
# macOS: dsymutil collects the DWARF from the object files into
# OUT_DIR/<name>.dSYM, keyed by the binary's UUID, then strip -S drops the
# debug map so the shipped binary carries no build paths. Run it before
# macdeployqt and codesign: the signature must cover the final bytes.
#
# Both write OUT_DIR/SYMBOLS.txt: one line per binary with its ID, so a crash
# report's build ID or UUID can be matched to an archive without unpacking it.
# A binary that does not exist is an error; a caller that builds an optional
# helper checks for it first.
