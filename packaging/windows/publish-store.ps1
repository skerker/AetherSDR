.SYNOPSIS
    Upload an AetherSDR MSIX build to Microsoft Store production or a flight.

.DESCRIPTION
    Wraps the Microsoft Store Developer CLI (`msstore`) publish step that the
    Windows Installer workflow runs on a `v*` tag push. It locates the
    `.msixupload` produced by create-msix.ps1 and hands it to `msstore publish`
    for the given Store product Id.

    By default it stages a DRAFT submission (`--noCommit`): the package is
    uploaded to Partner Center but certification is NOT started. A maintainer
    reviews the pending submission in Partner Center and clicks "Submit to
    Store" to begin certification. Pass -Commit to send a flight straight to
    certification; production also requires -CommitProduction explicitly.
    Pass -FlightId to target an existing Partner Center package flight. The
    package identity and ProductId remain those of the production app; the
    flight controls the restricted audience.

    Authentication is expected to already be configured via a prior
    `msstore reconfigure` call (tenant/seller/client id + client secret), which
    the workflow does from GitHub secrets.

    Behavior on a missing package is deliberate: the MSIX build step in CI is
    `continue-on-error`, so a flaky package build leaves no `.msixupload`. In
    that case this script warns and exits 0 rather than turning an
    already-completed release red — the missing-package failure is already
    surfaced by the MSIX step's own annotation. A genuine publish API failure
    still exits non-zero so it is visible.

.PARAMETER ProductId
    The 12-character Microsoft Store product Id for the AetherSDR listing.
    Defaults to $env:AETHERSDR_STORE_PRODUCT_ID.

.PARAMETER UploadGlob
    Glob used to find the upload package. Defaults to the create-msix.ps1
    naming convention "AetherSDR-*.msixupload".

.PARAMETER FlightId
    Optional Partner Center package flight Id. It must be passed explicitly;
    the production path never inherits a flight from the environment.

.PARAMETER SearchDir
    Directory to search for the upload package. Defaults to the current
    directory (where the workflow runs create-msix.ps1 with -OutputDir .).

.PARAMETER UploadTimeoutSeconds
    Network timeout, in seconds, for each Azure blob upload request. Defaults
    to 300. The CLI sets no StorageTransferOptions, so a .msixupload under
    256 MiB is sent as a single PUT and this timeout has to cover the entire
    transfer rather than one chunk. At ~200 MB the CLI's own 100 s default
    would require a sustained ~2 MB/s for the whole upload, so this is passed
    explicitly as a deliberate value.

.PARAMETER Commit
    Send the submission straight to certification instead of staging a draft.
    Drops the `--noCommit` safety gate. Production also requires -CommitProduction.

.PARAMETER CommitProduction
    Explicit second opt-in for -Commit without a flight. Cannot be used with a
    flight or without -Commit; ordinary tag builds pass neither switch.
