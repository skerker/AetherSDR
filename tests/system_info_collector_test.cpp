// #2554 (Memory tab) -- SystemInfoCollector publishes a process-memory sample on
// every tick, including the first, through a queued signal that survives the
// thread hop. Runs the real wiring (parentless collector moved onto a QThread,
// init() on QThread::started, the 1.5 s timer) rather than calling into the
// sampler directly, because the metatype registration and the queued copy are
// exactly what a unit that bypassed the thread would not exercise.
//
// The reading is MEASURED on this test process (a live ProcessMemorySnapshot,
// the precedent memory_telemetry_test sets); nothing here is constructed. No
// socket, no radio, no widget.
