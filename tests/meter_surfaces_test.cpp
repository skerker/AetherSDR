// The producer->consumer join, checked as a join.
//
// MeterSurfaces.h is the one table that knows a meter's whole path, and
// RadioCertification.cpp's kMeterTable is the executable form of the
// certification inventory. They are two hand-maintained tables keyed by the
// same "SRC:NAME" string, and the failure mode when they disagree is recorded
// in both files: kMeterSurfaces was widened to a unit SET, kMeterTable was left
// holding the old single-value column, and `radiocert meters` then reported
// `UNIT MISMATCH ... TX:ALC` on every healthy HL2 run and ranked it above every
// real finding (CERTIFICATION.md 1.38). A concern that never goes away stops
// being read, and takes the real ones with it.
//
// Nothing in the build could notice that, because the two tables never meet at
// compile time: kMeterTable lives in an anonymous namespace inside a
// translation unit that pulls in RadioModel, AudioEngine and the whole
// certification apparatus. So this reads it as TEXT. That is a real limitation
// and worth naming — the check is structural, not semantic, and it proves a row
// EXISTS rather than that its columns are right. It is still the check that
// would have caught 1.38's successor, which is a meter added to one table and
// forgotten in the other.
