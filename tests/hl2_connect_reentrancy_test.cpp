// What happens to a connect that arrives while the previous one's WDSP chains
// are still opening — and to that connect when the operator then disconnects.
//
// The connect stopped being one straight-line call: connectRadio() seeds its
// members, hands the channel opens to the I/O thread and returns, and
// finishDspSetup() picks the session back up an event-loop turn (or twenty
// seconds) later. That opened a window nothing could previously land in, and
// this test is about what lands in it.
//
// NO RADIO IS NEEDED. Everything under test happens before the wire matters:
// the DSP build runs against nothing, and the socket start at the end of
// finishDspSetup() binds locally whether or not anything answers. Each case is
// observed through dspSetupProgress/dspSetupFinished, which bracket exactly one
// build each.
