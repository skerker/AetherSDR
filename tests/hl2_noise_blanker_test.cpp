// HL2 impulse noise blanker — the host-side ANB stage ahead of the demodulator.
//
// The HL2 sends raw IQ and runs no firmware DSP, so its noise blanker either
// happens in WDSP on this host or it does not happen at all. That makes the
// interesting assertions BEHAVIOURAL rather than protocol-shaped: there is no
// register write to observe, only whether impulses actually stop reaching the
// audio. Every check here is differential — the same stimulus run twice, once
// with the blanker off and once on — so it measures the stage rather than the
// absolute levels of a chain that may be retuned later.
//
// Four things are pinned:
//   1. The blanker removes impulses and leaves the wanted signal alone.
//   2. The seam's 0..100 level maps onto WDSP's INVERTED threshold, with the
//      slice model's default of 50 landing on pihpsdr's fixed value of 20.
//   3. Transmit does not de-arm it. The mute path clocks the channel with
//      silence, and the blanker triggers on a RATIO against a running average
//      magnitude, so an unheld blanker would gate the start of every receive
//      period — the same failure family as the NR filter-state gap.
//   4. ...and it is still BLANKING there. (3) alone is satisfied by a stage
//      that does nothing at all, which is what flushing on the T->R edge
//      produces: flush sets the running average to full scale and the blanker
//      cannot trigger for ~200 ms. Both directions have to be pinned or the
//      hold can be "fixed" into uselessness without a test noticing.

    // watches its running average decay to nothing and then treats the first
    // real receive sample as an enormous impulse — a hole at the start of every
    // receive period.
    //
    // Differential again, and deliberately so: the mute path itself has a
    // settling cost (pipeline latency, the DC blocker) that both arms pay, so
    // the comparison is blanker-on recovery against blanker-off recovery rather
    // than against a hardcoded level.
