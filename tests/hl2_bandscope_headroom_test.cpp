// HL2 wideband bandscope headroom — the pure decisions in Hl2BandscopeHeadroom.h.
//
// No sockets, no Qt, no hardware. Everything here is reachable by arithmetic,
// which is the whole reason the decisions live in a header rather than inline
// in Hl2Backend: on a real radio these branches need an out-of-slice signal
// strong enough to overload a converter, and a test suite cannot arrange one.
//
// THE TWO ANCHORS THAT ARE NOT OURS TO CHOOSE, and they are what make this
// test worth having:
//
//   * THE GATEWARE'S OWN THRESHOLDS. ad9866.v fires rxclip at |code| == 2048
//     and rxgoodlvl at |code| >= 1536. Our dB scale must put those at 0.00 and
//     2.50 dB of headroom or it does not agree with the converter, and every
//     statement this header makes about "below the clip point" is then false.
//
//   * THE STUDY'S PUBLISHED BIAS TABLE. wideband-bandscope-headroom-sensor.md
//     4.2 tabulates the Gaussian expected-maximum bias at six duty cycles,
//     to two decimals, computed independently of this code. gatedPeakBiasDb
//     must reproduce it. A table written down in a document and a function
//     written later are exactly the pair that silently disagrees.
