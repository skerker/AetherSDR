// WdspChannel::processIq() distinguishes six outcomes. Until this test's
// change, Hl2RxDsp::processIqBlock and AnanRxDsp::processIqBlock collapsed all
// five non-`Ok` ones into a bare `continue` — no log line, no counter, no
// signal — so a chain producing no audio because WDSP was returning
// `EngineError` on every block was indistinguishable, from outside, from a
// chain whose pipeline was still filling. (S3-raw-iq-hardening §6.1; the
// study's own acceptance item U4.)
//
// WHAT THIS PINS, in three layers, because no one layer is enough:
//
//   1. THE RULE.  WdspProcessTally puts each of the six outcomes in its own
//      counter, and `faults()` contains the four that mean something is wrong
//      and NOT `Underrun`, which is normal. A counter is exactly the shape
//      that passes whatever the code does, so the rule is asserted per
//      enumerator rather than in aggregate.
//
//   2. THE WIRING, on a real HL2 chain and a real ANAN chain.  Both call
//      sites must actually reach the tally, and must reach it on EVERY block
//      including the ones that produced no audio: `ok + underrun + faults`
//      has to equal the number of blocks the stage handed to processIq(),
//      which this test computes independently from the sample count it fed.
//      Both backends, because a fix present in one and absent in the other is
//      worse than absent in both.
//
//   3. THAT `Underrun` IS NOT TREATED AS A FAULT.  A healthy chain underruns
//      — that is what the first blocks through a freshly opened WDSP channel
//      do — and must emit no warning for it. Asserted by counting the log
//      lines the change adds, not by reading the code.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT PIN, and why. `AllocationViolation`, `EngineError`,
// `InvalidBuffer` and `Busy` are not PRODUCED here through a live chain.
// Nothing in this codebase can make fexchange2 return a non-(-2) error or make
// WDSP allocate on demand; `InvalidBuffer` needs a span geometry
// processIqBlock() sizes itself and never gets wrong; and `Busy` needs a
// control operation in flight on a second thread, which §5.1's single-thread
// model makes unreachable on the HL2 path at all (S3 §9.4 says so in those
// words). Layer 1 therefore pins the CLASSIFICATION of all six by handing the
// tally each enumerator directly, and layer 2 pins that the call site hands it
// whatever processIq() actually returned. NOTHING HERE WAS MEASURED ON A
// RADIO: there is no hardware in this test and no simulator either.
