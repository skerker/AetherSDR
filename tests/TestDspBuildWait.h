// Waiting out the connect's asynchronous WDSP channel opens, for the HL2 tests.
//
// Hl2Backend::connectRadio() hands the opens to the I/O thread and returns
// (beginDspSetup), so the wire does not start until they finish. Every one of
// these tests runs on an isolated HOME — TestSettingsProfile re-roots it, and
// WdspChannel's wisdomPath() falls back to $HOME/.cache — which means an empty
// FFTW wisdom cache and a first open that genuinely spends tens of seconds
// measuring plans. That cost belongs to neither the radio nor anything under
// test, so waiting a fixed number of milliseconds for it would be measuring the
// host's CPU. The timing assertions AFTER a connect still use each test's own
// spin(), because those ARE the assertion.
//
// Shared rather than pasted into each test because the number below is a
// judgement about the slowest machine we expect to run on, and five copies of a
// judgement drift.
