// Construction smoke test for the System Info dialog (#2554).
//
// Written because the dialog shipped with a null dereference that a full build
// and 326 passing tests did not catch: rebuildCategoryFilters() reached through
// m_logViewer for a parent widget before m_logViewer existed, so the dialog
// crashed the instant it was constructed. Nothing in the suite constructed it.
//
// This is deliberately shallow — construct, show, hide, destroy — because that
// is the path that was broken. Depth can come later; coverage of the path an
// operator takes by clicking the menu item cannot.
