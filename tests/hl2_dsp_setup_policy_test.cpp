// When the DSP-setup phase is worth a warning, and when it is worth failing.
//
// The phase this governs had NO timeout at all (#5413): beginDspSetup() hands
// the WDSP opens to the I/O thread and returns, finishDspSetup() is posted back
// when they finish, and between those points nothing was watching. The only
// connect watchdog lives in MetisClient::start(), which is reached after this
// phase — so a stall here was outside every guard in the path and a caller got
// the same reply a successful connect gives, then silence.
//
// Timing behaviour is otherwise reachable only by running a radio, which is why
// it is a pure function here — the layer #5358 asks for.
//
// THE TWO STAGES ARE THE POINT. A first WDSP open on a machine with no FFTW
// wisdom cache measures 35 plans per channel with FFTW_PATIENT and legitimately
// takes minutes; with the cache it is seconds. A single tight timeout would
// therefore fail a connect that is working, so the warn stage exists to say
// "slow, still going" and only the far stage fails.
//
// THE NUMBERS BELOW ARE MEASUREMENTS, AND THEY MOVED THE BOUND. The first
// version of this file asserted that an open still running at 150 s "has
// failed", against a 90 s bound. Both were wrong: a cold first open on an IDLE
// machine measures 98269 ms
// (streams/hl2-telemetry/runs/d57_bench_quiet_result.txt, 21 load samples
// between 3.3 and 4.1), so 90 s failed a working connect every time on a quiet
// machine, and 150 s is inside the working range rather than outside it. Under
// load the same open is 188128 ms and whole cold connects are 193-219 s
// (streams/hl2-telemetry/runs/d57_quiet_connect.py). And the largest figure is
// not this bench's at all: #4877, closed, reports 178.7 s on an i9-13980HX and
// 188-190 s across four CI runs as the EXPECTED cold cost. Hence the checks
// here run against 600 s.
