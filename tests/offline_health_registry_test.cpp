// Health that survives disconnection, gated on a DECLARATION rather than on a
// family string.
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACED, and why the replacement is not cosmetic. The first
// version of this feature gated its two model-level entry points on
// `m_family != QLatin1String("hl2")`. `docs/HERMES.md`'s "For coding agents —
// keep bring-up inside the family backend" (jensenpat, f6f56458, merged in
// 1457d06d) forbids exactly that construct above the seam, and #5554 §2.8
// separately wants the `dynamic_cast<hl2::Hl2Backend*>` shape retired. Neither
// is a style note: a family test above the seam excludes anything that behaves
// the same way without carrying the name, which is the same defect #5618 fixed
// for extension namespaces.
//
// So the model asks OfflineHealthRegistry what the selected family declared,
// and `src/core/backends/hl2/Hl2TelemetryService.cpp` is what declares it.
//
// THE ASSERTION THAT MATTERS MOST IS THE FIRST ONE. A self-registering
// translation unit that nothing references can be dropped from a static archive
// with no diagnostic anywhere, and the feature then does not exist while every
// other test still passes. That failure is silent by construction, so it gets
// an explicit check rather than trust.
//
// SOCKET-FREE, and by construction rather than by choice of address. The
// earlier version of this file claimed it and was wrong: aiming the real HL2
// source through the model is a synchronous chain — `setOfflineHealthTarget()`
// calls `noteOfflineDemand()`, `Hl2TelemetryService::noteDemand()` applies the
// surface-visible cadence immediately, and `Hl2TelemetryPoller::applyCadence()`
// then binds a UDP socket and calls `onPollTimer()` inline, which writes a
// discovery datagram. TEST-NET-1 is unroutable, so it went to the default
// gateway and no further — but the declaration was false and the test bound a
// socket in ctest's default graph. Reported by ten9876 on #5642, measured under
// an LD_PRELOAD shim on bind/sendmsg.
//
// AGENTS.md's socket carve-out does not cover it either: that exempts tests
// where OUR OWN SERVER is the subject, reached over a socket. Here the subject
// is a registry gate and the socket is a side effect of using the whole stack
// to reach it, which is the case the same table routes to "inject the
// transport".
//
// So section 5 injects one. It re-declares the `hl2` family with a recording
// source that owns no socket, which tests MORE of the verb than aiming the real
// one did — the address it was handed and the demand it was told about are now
// assertions rather than side effects. Sections 1-3 run first and against the
// real declaration; section 3's freshly built service has no target, so its
// cadence is zero and it binds nothing.
