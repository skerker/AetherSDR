// A 1 Hz counter cannot be sampled at 1 Hz to decide "did anything arrive".
//
// THE DEFECT, observed live on 2026-09-04 with a healthy stream. During a
// connected session with EP6 arriving continuously, telemetryPollMs oscillated
// 0 -> 500 -> 0 across the run and stream-free replies actually landed: the app
// was emitting port-1025 datagrams through its own healthy stream, which is the
// one thing Config C asserts must never happen. The stream was not stalled --
// the in-band temperature changed on every sample throughout.
//
// The cause is two clocks sampling each other, both nominally 1000 ms:
//
//   Hl2Backend::kTelemetryPollStateIntervalMs   the tick that decides the state
//   MetisClient::kLinkPublishIntervalMs         the mirror the tick reads
//
// Cited by symbol rather than by file:line on purpose. This comment first
// carried line numbers and both were stale within the hour -- the fix below
// added ten lines above one of them, and the other pointed at the USE site
// while the constant is declared in the header. A citation that rots silently
// is worse than one a reader has to grep for.
//
// updateTelemetryPollState() asked whether m_link.rxPackets had changed SINCE
// THE LAST TICK, but that field is only refreshed by linkCountersUpdated at
// 1 Hz. Whenever two ticks fall between two publishes, the second sees an
// unchanged counter and declares StreamStalled on a perfectly healthy stream.
//
// WHY THIS IS A PROOF AND NOT A TUNED SIMULATION. The publish is gated by
// `elapsed() < kLinkPublishIntervalMs`, checked on packet arrival, so its period
// is bounded BELOW by 1000 ms and is in practice a little more. The tick is a
// steady 1000 ms. A sequence that is never faster than the tick and sometimes
// slower must fall behind without bound, so a tick with no intervening publish
// is not a possibility, it is a certainty -- only its arrival time is in doubt.
// The jitter below is therefore deterministic and merely decides WHEN, never
// WHETHER. That is why this test does not depend on a lucky seed, and why the
// 60 s Config C capture that saw nothing was too short to bound the beat rather
// than evidence that there was none.
//
// The legacy predicate is kept here permanently as a NEGATIVE CONTROL. A test
// that only exercised the new rule would pass just as well against a rule that
// never reports a stall at all; asserting that the old one DOES fail on this
// trace is what proves the trace discriminates. Four times in this session a
// correct rule sat behind a passing test with nothing asking it.
